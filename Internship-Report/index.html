This allows them to gain firsthand experience and learn how to apply counselling techniques in practice.</p><p>Developing counselling skills: Trainee counsellors work on developing their counselling skills, such as active listening, empathy, rapport-building, and effective communication. They may practise these skills through role-plays, mock counselling sessions, or supervised counselling sessions with clients.</p><p>Conducting assessments: Under supervision, trainee counsellors may be involved in conducting client assessments. This involves gathering information about the client&rsquo;s background, history, concerns, and goals to better understand their needs and develop appropriate treatment plans.</p><p>Attending training and supervision sessions: Trainee counsellors participate in regular training and supervision sessions where they discuss their cases, receive feedback on their counselling techniques, and learn from the expertise of their supervisors. These sessions are crucial for their professional development and growth.</p><p>Understanding ethical guidelines: Trainee counsellors are expected to adhere to ethical guidelines and professional standards of practice. They must maintain client confidentiality, respect boundaries, and ensure the well-being of their clients.</p><p>Process of engagement – activities undertaken</p><ul><li>How to fill in a case report</li><li>How to use inventories and questionnaires</li><li>Case studies</li><li>Case discussions</li><li>Learning more about formal diagnoses</li><li>Learning methods / breathing techniques</li></ul><p>Begin the case report with relevant identifying information such as the client&rsquo;s initials, date of birth, gender, and diagnosis if any.<br>Presenting Problem: Provide a concise and clear description of the client&rsquo;s main reason for seeking counselling or therapy. Include details about their symptoms, concerns, or issues they are currently facing. This section should focus on the client&rsquo;s perspective and subjective experience.<br>Background Information: Include relevant background information about the client, such as their personal history, family dynamics, educational background, employment, and any significant life events or trauma that may be relevant to their current concerns.<br>Assessment: Describe the assessment process you conducted to gather information about the client&rsquo;s psychological functioning. This may involve formal assessments, interviews, observations, or reviewing existing records. Include any assessment tools or measures you used and provide a summary of the findings.<br>Diagnosis: If you have conducted a diagnostic evaluation and arrived at a formal diagnosis based on established diagnostic criteria, include the diagnosis in this section. Provide a rationale for the diagnosis based on the client&rsquo;s symptoms and assessment results.<br>Treatment Plan: Outline the goals, objectives, and strategies you have developed for the client&rsquo;s treatment. Describe the therapeutic approaches, interventions, or techniques you plan to utilise to address their concerns. Consider incorporating evidence-based practices and tailoring the treatment plan to the client&rsquo;s individual needs and preferences.<br>Progress and Session Notes: Document the progress of the client&rsquo;s treatment over time. Include detailed session notes for each counselling session, highlighting the topics discussed, interventions used, the client&rsquo;s response, and any notable changes or insights. Be sure to maintain client confidentiality and adhere to ethical guidelines.<br>Outcome and Recommendations: Summarise the overall progress and outcomes of the client&rsquo;s treatment. Reflect on the effectiveness of the interventions used and discuss any changes in the client&rsquo;s symptoms or functioning. Provide recommendations for future treatment or referrals, if applicable.<br>Conclusion: Conclude the case report by summarising the main points and highlighting any key insights or learnings from the case. You may also include your own reflections or thoughts on the case, as well as any follow-up plans.<br>Case Discussions<br>Case discussion is a vital component of various educational and professional settings, particularly in fields like medicine, law, business, and academia. It refers to a collaborative and interactive process where individuals analyse and explore real or hypothetical scenarios, often involving complex problems or decision-making dilemmas.<br>During a case discussion, participants are presented with a specific case study or scenario that encapsulates key details and pertinent information. The primary objective is to foster critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and analytical reasoning by engaging in a structured conversation. Participants are encouraged to examine the case from multiple perspectives, offer insights, share experiences, and propose potential solutions or strategies.<br>Case discussions provide a platform for individuals to enhance their knowledge, develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter, and refine their decision-making abilities. The process encourages active participation, stimulates intellectual curiosity, and promotes the exchange of diverse viewpoints. By exploring different angles, participants gain exposure to varied strategies and approaches, which can broaden their own problem-solving repertoire.<br>Furthermore, case discussions facilitate the development of essential skills such as effective communication, active listening, and the ability to articulate and defend one&rsquo;s viewpoint. Participants learn to engage in respectful debates, challenge assumptions, and consider alternative perspectives, leading to a richer and more comprehensive exploration of the case.<br>Overall, case discussions serve as a valuable learning tool, fostering a collaborative environment where individuals can engage in rigorous analysis, learn from each other&rsquo;s experiences, and collectively develop a deeper understanding of complex problems.<br>Formal Diagnosis<br>Formal diagnosis in psychology refers to the process of identifying and categorising mental health disorders based on established criteria and guidelines. It involves the use of standardised assessment tools and diagnostic manuals to determine if an individual meets the criteria for a specific psychological disorder.<br>The process of formal diagnosis typically involves several steps. First, the clinician gathers information through interviews, observation, and psychological tests. This information helps to assess the individual&rsquo;s symptoms, history, and functioning in various areas of life. Next, the clinician compares the collected information to the diagnostic criteria outlined in the DSM or other relevant diagnostic manuals.<br>To make a formal diagnosis, the clinician must determine if the individual&rsquo;s symptoms align with the specific criteria for a particular disorder. They consider the duration, intensity, and impact of the symptoms on the individual&rsquo;s daily life. Additionally, they rule out other possible explanations for the symptoms, such as medical conditions or substance abuse.<br>Formal diagnosis in psychology provides a standardised language and framework for understanding and communicating about mental health conditions. It helps in developing personalised treatment plans, facilitating research, and ensuring consistency and accuracy in the field of psychology.</p><p>Learning methods / breathing techniques<br>Breathing methods play a crucial role in various therapeutic approaches and can significantly contribute to overall well-being. These techniques focus on the conscious control and regulation of breath, which can have a profound impact on physical, mental, and emotional states.<br>One commonly used breathing method in therapy is diaphragmatic breathing, also known as belly breathing. It involves deep inhalation, where the diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle located below the lungs, expands, and the abdomen rises. This technique promotes relaxation, reduces stress, and helps in managing anxiety and panic disorders.<br>Another beneficial breathing method is paced breathing, which involves breathing at a specific rhythm or pace. This technique often utilises the 4-7-8 breathing pattern, where one breathes in for a count of 4, holds the breath for a count of 7, and exhales slowly for a count of 8. Paced breathing can induce a calming effect, regulate heart rate, and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and stress.<br>Furthermore, alternate nostril breathing, a yogic breathing technique, involves inhaling and exhaling through one nostril at a time while closing the other nostril with a finger. This practice is believed to balance energy, improve focus, and promote a sense of calm.<br>Breathing methods in therapy work by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which counteracts the &ldquo;fight-or-flight&rdquo; response and promotes relaxation. These techniques can be integrated into various therapeutic modalities, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based therapies, and stress management programs.<br>By incorporating breathing methods into therapy, individuals can develop effective self-regulation skills, enhance their ability to manage emotions, reduce physical tension, and cultivate a greater sense of overall well-being. These techniques are accessible, practical, and can be utilised outside of therapy sessions, making them valuable tools for self-care and stress reduction.</p><p>Key Outcomes and Impacts<br>Better understanding of mental health landscape<br>During my psychology internship, I was able to gain a better understanding of the mental health landscape. I learned about different mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I also learned about different treatment modalities, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy and psychodynamic therapy. One of the most valuable things about my internship was the opportunity to work with clients and see how different interventions can help them. I was also able to learn from experienced professionals and get a sense of what it&rsquo;s like to work in the field of psychology. Overall, my internship was an incredibly valuable experience that helped me to grow both personally and professionally.<br>Better at conversations and relations in day-to-day life<br>Learning therapy skills has been incredibly helpful in real life conversations. One of the most important skills that I&rsquo;ve learned is active listening. This involves really paying attention to what the other person is saying, and making sure that I understand their perspective. I&rsquo;ve found that this skill has been really helpful in my personal relationships, because it allows me to be more present and engaged in conversations.</p><p>Another skill that I&rsquo;ve learned is how to communicate more effectively. This involves being clear and direct in my communication, while also being empathetic and understanding. I&rsquo;ve found that this skill has been particularly helpful in my work life, where I need to communicate with colleagues and clients on a regular basis. I think that learning therapy skills can be incredibly valuable in real life conversations. Whether you&rsquo;re talking to a friend, a family member, or a colleague, these skills can help you to communicate more effectively and build stronger relationships.</p><p>Therapist-Client Dynamics<br>It is crucial to understand the dynamics and the relationship shared between a therapist and their client. I learnt the importance of confidentiality, accountability, resourcefulness and also the extent of my abilities. Therapists are required to not give advice but help their client in their journey. It made me better understand the role of the therapist in one’s mental health journey.</p><p>It taught me about boundaries and how to draw them effectively and politely.</p><p>Deeper Insight on the Human Mind<br>Therapy helps us identify and treat various psychological disorders, such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, autism, and dementia. By studying the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of these conditions, we can help people who suffer from mental health problems as well as those close to them. We gain a richer understanding of the human mind</p><p>Key learnings and Conclusion<br>Better understanding of disorders, and behavioural issues<br>We were able to apply the theories and concepts we learned in the classroom to real-life situations. We could also observe how different disorders and behavioural issues affect people’s thoughts, feelings, and actions, and how they can be treated or managed.</p><p>We saw different kinds of clients with different ailments and issues.</p><p>Some of the cases we studied are elaborated on below. Names have been fictionalised to help protect the identity of the people. The cases have been reproduced after permission from the respective clients.</p><p>Case 1</p><p>We had the opportunity to be part of an ongoing case where we met Amoolya.<br>Amoolya is a 23-year-old woman who is good in academics but takes impulsive decisions and changes them quickly. She has had confusion selecting a path, and has experienced many job and stream changes. Amoolya compares herself to others and is too critical of herself.<br>Amoolya&rsquo;s mother takes therapy for depression, but her father is a bit aggressive. She has had unstable relationships where almost everyone has taken advantage of her. Amoolya has been diagnosed with a behavioural disorder, specifically narcissistic personality disorder.</p><p>Amoolya has developed an interest in going through the garbage and throwing it inside and outside her house, which has led to complaints from the neighbours and garbage pickers for destroying the property. She would go through the garbage of her neighbours.</p><p>Currently, Amoolya is doing MBA in distance education and takes tuition for kids in 6th grade. However, she constantly has a loss of interest in doing things but gains it back.</p><p>Case 2<br>In this case, we were introduced to Rahul, a thirteen year old. Rahul had a good academic record until fourth grade, after which his grades started to fall. His mother was a homemaker while his dad was a businessman. His mother had always been very critical when it came to Rahul’s studies. He was shouted at and had a considerable amount of pressure to perform well.<br>Soon, he started to rebel when he was not allowed to go out to play with his friends or was questioned / asked to study. He ran away from home twice according to his parents.</p><p>During the covid pandemic, he was restricted to his house like most other people. During this time, he got addicted to the Internet and computers. He would spend all his time on the web. His sleep had become very erratic, his diet largely consisted of junk food and multiple servings of energy drinks and sodas. His lifestyle had become very unhealthy. Add to that, he was mostly sedentary and did not do chores or any work. He had begun skipping school. He apparently made money online and had convinced his friends and family that he was caught in the “dark web” and that it was hard for him to get out. He told them that he was caught in the illicit trade of firearms. Soon, he started using this as a badge of honor. We were told that most of his apartment, his friends, his relatives, and the school were aware of this “situation”.</p><p>He was also verbally and physically abusive to his parents. His prognosis got better as he was weaned off the computer and shifted to a residential school. Previous to that, he had tried running away too.</p><p>These two were some of our most notable cases.

As someone who&rsquo;s passionate about helping others and supporting people through difficult times, I found that working with a diverse range of clients during my internship was incredibly rewarding.</p><p>Of course, it&rsquo;s important to note that an internship in counseling therapy can also be challenging. I worked with clients who were dealing with a wide range of issues, and it could be emotionally taxing at times. However, having a strong support system in place and practicing self-care helped me manage the stress and avoid burnout. I think an internship in counseling therapy is a valuable experience that can help you develop the skills you need to be an effective therapist. If you&rsquo;re interested in pursuing an internship, I would encourage you to reach out to local mental health clinics or private practices to see if they have any opportunities available</p><p>In my experience, an internship in counseling therapy can be a great way to gain hands-on experience in the mental health field.

You can also speak with your academic advisor or career center to learn more about internship opportunities in your area</p><p>Limitations</p><p>As therapists, we have certain limitations that we must be aware of. One of the biggest limitations is that we can&rsquo;t &ldquo;fix&rdquo; our clients&rsquo; problems or make them go away. Our role is to provide support, guidance, and tools to help clients manage their symptoms and work through their issues. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s up to the client to do the work and make the changes they need to improve their mental health.</p><p>Another limitation is that we can&rsquo;t force our clients to follow our advice or recommendations. We can offer suggestions and strategies, but it&rsquo;s up to the client to decide whether or not they want to try them. This can be frustrating at times, especially when we see clients struggling and we know what could help them.</p><p>Finally, we have to be mindful of our own biases and limitations as therapists. We all have our own experiences and perspectives, and it&rsquo;s important to recognize when those might be influencing our work with clients. We also have to be aware of our own limitations in terms of our training and expertise. If we encounter a client with a specific issue that we&rsquo;re not qualified to address, we need to refer them to someone who is.</p><p>Overall, being a therapist can be incredibly rewarding, but it&rsquo;s important to be aware of our limitations and work within them to provide the best possible care to our clients.</p><p>Future scope</p><p>As a counseling psychology student, I&rsquo;m excited about the future scope of this field. With mental health awareness on the rise, there&rsquo;s a growing need for trained professionals who can provide support and guidance to those in need.</p><p>One area of growth in counseling psychology is the use of technology to provide mental health services. This includes teletherapy, online counseling, and mobile apps that provide mental health support. These technologies make it easier for people to access mental health services from the comfort of their own homes.</p><p>Another area of growth is the focus on diversity and inclusion in counseling psychology. As our society becomes more diverse, it&rsquo;s important for mental health professionals to be able to work with clients from a variety of backgrounds and cultures. Counseling psychology programs are placing a greater emphasis on cultural competence and diversity training to prepare students for this shift.</p><p>Finally, there&rsquo;s a growing need for counseling psychology services in non-traditional settings, such as schools, workplaces, and community centers. This presents new opportunities for counseling psychologists to work with clients who might not otherwise seek out mental health services.</p><p>Overall, I believe that the future of counseling psychology is bright, and I&rsquo;m excited to be a part of this field as it continues to grow and evolve</p><p>Weekly Progress Report</p><p>SCHOOL OF HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES</p><p>Week Date External Supervisor Name Task Handled Learnings External Supervisor Feedback Internal Guide Feedback<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4</p><p>Signature of Student Seal & Signature of Company Guide</p><p>Remarks from the Company Guide:<br>Intern &mldr;&mldr;&mldr;&mldr;&mldr;&mldr;&mldr;has been a keen student with great interest in understanding the day to day classes.
