I remember this one time I was walking with a friend towards the back gate of Christ. There was a really cool milkshake place right outside the gate. I was probably heading there. (Their kitkat milkshakes were bomb)

So I was just there, walking when you stopped me. Hurried. A hint of hopelessness, a bit of sadness in your voice.
