# Attention
## Meaning 

> [! QUESTION] What is Attention?
> Attention is a **cognitive process** of selectively concentrating on a **discrete  aspect of information**, whether considered subjective or objective, while  **ignoring other perceivable information**
>

> [! TLDR] TLDR; 
> Concentrating on one task while ignoring other stimuli (**filtering**)
> Prioritize stimuli based on goals and needs


## Factors Affecting Attention
|             Internal  aka subjective           |  External  |
|:--------------------------------:|:----------:|
|             Interest             |   Nature   |
|              Motive              | Intensity  |
|            Mental Set            |    Size    |

### Internal Factors
AKA Subjective factors. Depend from person to person. 
1. **Interest** | 
2. **Motive** | basic needs and motives > other ones; what we want to do; task at hand
3. **Mental Set** |  readiness to respond; expecting a stimulus
4. **Past Experiences** | 
5. **Emotions** | 
6. **Habits** |
7. **Aim** |
8. **Organic state**| Hunger, sleep, etc

### External Factors
1. **Nature**    | Pic >>> Words
2. **Intensity** | Louder >> Softer
3. **Size**  |  Larger >> Smaller
4. **Repetition** | More times >> Less times
5. **Contrast** | Stark difference, can be in colours or concepts
6. **Novelty** | Something new, out of place
7. **Location** | Center >> other places
8. **Movement** | Moving >> Static




## Types of Attention
### 1. Based on Needs
a) **Sustained Attention**
	 it is the ability to pay attention to **only one task** by **consciously concentrating** on that task only for a **long time** enough and by **avoiding all other forms of distractions** or deviations. <u>Eg - reading a book, memorizing a chapter or following a classroom lecture.</u>
	
b) **Selective Attention**: 
	In this case, the listener **chooses to pay attention to only a *specific stimulus*** which is present in the environment while **ignoring the other stimuli**. This kind of attention does not depend on the stimulus but depends essentially on the attentive capabilities of an observer. Choosing to focus on a friend's voice (while in a crowd with them)
	
c) **Divided Attention**: 
	In case of divided attention, **the user pays attention to two or more *tasks* at the same time** and is also sometimes regarded as <strong><u>Multi-tasking</u></strong> which involves juggling between two or more than two tasks at the same time. Divided attention uses a lot of mental focus; ergo person **may get exhausted very quickly.** Function is impaired. **Split our attention**
	
d) **Alternating Attention**: 
	Though this attention can be closely related to divided attention, but is different as in case of divided attention we split our attention between two tasks, while in case of alternating attention, **the entire attention is shifted from one task to another** or is done alternately.

### 2. Based on Volition   
   a) **Voluntary** (aka volitional)
	requires will and determination
	**not** spontaneous
	*conscious effort*
	**goal based**
	eg - doing math 

   b) **Involuntary** (aka non-volitional)
	   does not involve any role of will
	   *instinctual* 
	   **spontaneous**
	   enforced attention
	   eg - mom hearing baby 

Auditory - ability to pay attention to auditory stimuli, related to temporal 
Visual - visual stimuli, related to spatial 

# <u>Models of Attention</u>
## **Selective**
### 1. Broadbent's Model of Selective Attention | Early Selection Theory
```mermaid 
graph LR

one[Attended Stimuli]--> A

two[Unattended Stimuli]--> A

A[Sensory Register] --Attended--> B(Selective Filter)

L[Selective filter removes <br> the unattended stimuli <br> completely]

A--Unattended-->B

B --> |Bottleneck| C(Working Memory)

C --> D(Other Cognitive Functions)
```

All stimuli is registered in the sensory register, and then they go through the selective filter which filters out <u>based on <b>physical characteristics</b></u>
After selective filter, **meaning** is assigned to the stimuli and then processed

**selection of stimuli** for processing occurs <b><u>before</u></b> **stimulus identification** (Early Selection)

<u><strong>Bottleneck theory</u></strong> - individuals have a limited amount of attentional resources that they can use at one time

### 2. Treisman's Model | **Attenuation Theory**
<b><u>Attenuation</u> </b>- the lessening or weakening in the intensity, value, or quality of a stimulus 

<u>unattended messages</u> are **attenuated** or processed weakly but **not** entirely blocked from further processing
	 Thus, a significant word (e.g., the person’s name) would have a <u>low threshold</u> and, when mentioned, would be recognized even if that person’s attention is concentrated elsewhere 
	(**Cocktail Party Effect**)

```mermaid

one[Attended <br> Stimuli]--> A

two[Unattended <br> Stimuli]--> A

A[Sensory <br> Register] --Attended--> B(Attenuator)

L[Attenuator weakens <br> the stimuli and <br> sends it to the <br> dictionary unit] 

A--Unattended-->B

B --> |Attended| C(Dictionary <br> Unit)

B -.-> |Weakened <br> Unattended| C

C --> D(Other Cognitive Functions)

``` 

## **Divided**
### 3. Kahneman's Model 
[[Daniel Kahneman]]
Attention is scarce. Some tasks require more, some less. 
We can do multiple tasks at once as long as it is within the capacity of attention.
mental "juggling" 
mental efforts
total available processing capacities depends on arousal and other factors
***Central Allocation Policy***

> You can do several things at once, but only if they are easy and undemanding. 
> More than once as long as it is within the processing capacity available

Easy or diff 
Similarity of tasks 
Practice

```

**Interference** is the term used to describe when a  
person has a<u> hard time attending to two stimuli</u> at a  
time. We see interference when the brain is only able  
to process a certain amount of information

##### **Momentary intention**: 
A conscious decision to  
allocate attention to certain aspects of the  
environment.  

##### Enduring disposition
An automatic influence 
where people direct their attention.

Broadbent, Treisman -> Selective Attention Theory
Kahneman -> Divided Attention Theory

---
<u>Broadbent</u> -> said that filtered out by physical properties, semantic analyis is not done, meaning is not assigned to unattended stimuli, 

-> Sensory Register ->Selective Filter ->Working Memory -> Other Cog functions

---
<u>Treisman</u> -> signal is weakened, everything is processed, some words have lower thresholds than others, CPE

-> Sensory Register -> Attenuator -> Dictionary Unit -> Other Cog functions

---
<u>Kahneman</u> -> CAP, can attend to multiple stimuli, each task requires diff amount of effort 

**-> Arousal -> Central Processing Unit -> Evaluation of demand -> Response**
