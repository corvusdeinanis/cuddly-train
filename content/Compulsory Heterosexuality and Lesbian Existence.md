**personal notes**:
prof conflates  cis with sexual attraction 
	conflates cis with het 

- radfem is supposed to be **provocative**! People dilute their thoughts and everything. [[Movements Dilute in the Mainstream]]  Judging her and her work because of the tone is [[Tone Policing]]. You CAN'T tone police a member of the marginalized sect of society. 

- Queer people are seen under the microscope, scrutinized so much. Homophobic speech gets a pass. But God forbid someone says the opposite. 

- The MOVEMENT IS **NOT EXTREME**.  If you're cornered and beaten day in and day out for years, it is only self defense to fight back. Society only looks when the opressed strike back but turns a blind eye towards the whole "violence" thing when it is the oppressed at the recieving end. 

- Revionist =/= responding to criticism. It is erasing and making new history.
- Revised, not revisionist 
- Revisionist has negative connotations
