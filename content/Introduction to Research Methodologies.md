# What is research? 

- "**systemized** way to gain new information" 
- "movement from known to unknown"
- going from problem to conclusion
- search for knowledge
- using current information to add new, unique information to the body of information
- to increase stock of knowledge

According to Clifford Woody,  
	defining and redefining problems, 
	formulating hypothesis; 
	collecting, organizing and evaluating data; 
	making deductions and reaching conclusions; 
	and at last carefully testing the conclusions


## Characteristics 
- is scientific
- any branch of knowledge
- rational
- based on facts, rooted in reality 

- Generalized
- Controlled
- Rigorous
- Empirical 
- Systematic
- [[Reliability and Validity]]
- Credible
- Critical 

## Objectives of Research 
- discover answers using scietific procedures 
- to gain **familiarity** with a phenomenon (exploratory/formulatory)
- to **accurately represent** characteristics of an individual / group (descriptive)
- to determine frequency of a particular event (diagnostic)
- establish causal relationship (hypothesis testing)

## Motivation for research 
(this is bleh and is included only because it is part of the syllabus)
1. Discover something new
2. Portray actual characteristics of any phenomena
3. Establish causal relationship
4. Confirm existing relationships / validity of the same
5. To get a research degree and consequential benefits (really? "motivation to do it - have to do it")
6. Desire to help society 
7. Desire to gain respect

## Types of Research

A-->B(descriptive)
A-->C(analytical)

A-->F(quantitative)
A-->G(qualitative)

B---BI(accurate portrayal of situation/people, <br> no control over variables <br> what, not why <br> )

C---CI(uses facts, reasoning, and <br> critical thinking to <br> derive causal relationships)

D---DI(scientific study to solve practical problems<br>to find a solution<br>any problem faced by society or a business<br>action oriented)

E---EI(aka pure or basic<br>gathering knowledge for knowledge's sake<br>to add more information)

F---|measuring quantity|Y(descriptive, survey,<br> correlational, quasi-experimental, experimental)

G---|collecting and understanding <br> non-numerical data|W
W(open conversations, indepth interviews, <br>esp important in behavioural sciences)

```
mnemonic: DAAFQQ (pronounced dafuq) 

Descriptive vs Analytical (just studying something or causal link finding?)
Applied vs Fundamental (solving a problem or acquiring new knowledge?)
Quantitative vs Qualitative (measuring numerical data vs non-numerical)

### Other types of research 

one-time research vs longitudinal (single time period vs several time periods)
field setting vs laboratory setting (control over variables)

clinical / diagnostic method (case study, indepth)
historical 
exploratory vs formalized (exploratory - a topic/phenomenon that hasn't been explored much; formalized - trying to replicate an experiment, if successful, can be applied to a larger group or universe)

## Types of groups

### 1) **Between group difference**
   between two or more groups - for eg, groups based on gender; control and test group; etc 
   
### 2) **Within group** 
   the differences between the members of the same group 
   
### 3) **Repeated measures design** 
   fewer participants but all of them go through all the conditions
   they serve as their own control
   repeat the experiment 
   crossover studies are an example 
   for eg, two treatments, medicine and placebo. 
   the treatments are randomized and given to the subject, and then it is repeated. So a subject will receive the treatments in a random order, and will receive both types of treatment (as a rule of repeated measures design)  
   
### 4) Blocking 
   In blocking method, people with a similarity are grouped together. For example, sex. Two blocks, one with male and one with female. From these blocks, the members are assigned control or  test randomly. This ensures **balanced** control and test groups.

P-->O(Female)
N-->X(Control)
N-->Y(Test)
O-->X
O-->Y
end 

```
