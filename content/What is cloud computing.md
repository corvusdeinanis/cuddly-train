# What is Cloud Computing? 
it is the **on-demand** delivery of IT resources over the Internet with **pay-as-you-go pricing**
on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user

## Characteristics 
on-demand 
	can use whenever needed
	once configured, it can be automated (?) 
ubiquitous access  
	widely accessible 
	this is done using different protocols, devices, interfaces, security technologies 
	tailored to particular needs 	
[[Multitenancy in Cloud Computing]] 
elasticity, scalability 
resilience
measured usage  
## Advantages
Cost Effective 
	Computing as a **Utility** - Pay for what you use
	Cost sharing of data centers
	minimal to no maintenance required
	Energy consumption saved 
	no need to hire experts 
	servicing and upgrading not required 

**Elasticity** - easily scale up or down dynamically

Remote Access, Collaboration
	can share info 
	access files real time 
	across the globe 

Multiple services offered in a single location 
Speed of operations
Sever Provisioning
Server Cloning
Built-in services for disaster recovery and failover
Data center security and certifications

## Disadvantages
- we do not have physical control of data 
- limited control over physical resources 
- possibility of unwarranted shutdown
- have to rely on third party security 

# Building a Cloud Environment / Cloud Infrastructure 

Choose the **cloud infrastructure** based on your business use case 
Types of cloud infrastructure - 
## Private
completely dedicated to one end user or group, maintained on a private network
two types: 
### 1. dedicated cloud infrastructure 
IT infrastructure is devoted to a single client with totally segregated access
### 2. managed private cloud
 third-party provider deploys, configures, and manages a private cloud on behalf of its customers
## Public 
third party cloud providers who provide services over the Internet; eg Microsoft       Azure, AWS 
## Hybrid 
combination of private and public 
combines on-premises infrastructure—or a private cloud—with a public cloud 
edge computing 
## Multicloud 
A multi-cloud architecture consists of multiple cloud services from various public or private cloud vendors. All hybrid cloud environments are multi-clouds. However, not all multi-cloud environments are hybrid clouds.
