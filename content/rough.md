### ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE OF A NEWSPAPER

Journalism is one of the most important professions in the world. It informs citizens about various events that take place in our community, state, country and beyond. The reports and analyses of journalists help people know the current affairs and to form opinions. Journalists inform the public through newspapers, magazines, radio, television, internet etc. These means of communication are often referred to as the news media.

Newspapers are daily engaged in the gathering, packaging and distribution of news, opinions and pictures from across the globe. Mass media shape and mould public opinion and represent social reality. They are complex and multi- faceted organisations involving huge business and commercial interests. Efficient and harmonious coordination of various departments of a newspaper are essential if it is to effectively function as a professional and business entity. The mere collection of news and its distribution alone will not ensure the successful functioning of a newspaper. Advertisements in a newspaper are the basis of its stability and profitability. Similarly, a paper must have good circulation. The greater the circulation the greater will be the volume of advertisements. The mechanical production (print quality) and the distribution of newspapers also play a key role

The organizational setup varies from newspaper to newspaper depending on the size and turnover of a newspaper. Generally most of the newspapers have three major departments – editorial, business and mechanical. Large newspapers may have more departments such as Human Resource Development, Public Relations,

Personnel and Administration. However, editorial, business and mechanical are the core departments of a newspaper. Let us discuss the most important characteristics of these departments.

**1** The editorial department is the key section of a newspaper. The news, features, comments, columns, editorials, cartoons, letters to the editor are handled by this section under the leadership of the editor or editor-in-chief. A host of assistant editors, news editors, sub-editors, special correspondents and reporters work under the editor. The chief reporter along with a team of reporters collects news from various places. These reports are edited by a team of sub editors under the supervision of a news editor. Most newspapers have separate desks for local, regional, national and foreign news. Presently, most of the newspapers have online editions. A team of journalists will edit, design and present the content for the internet editions.

**Business Department**

The business department of a newspaper is of prime importance. To function properly and effectively, a newspaper has to be run as a business enterprise. Usually, the business department consists of two sections, namely, advertising and circulation.

**3. Mechanical Department**

The mechanical section of a newspaper is in charge of the actual production of the paper. This section deals with the composing, plate making, printing, packing

Every newspaper in India is required under the law to print the name of the editor on every issue. This pins responsibility on the editor for what goes to print. If a newspaper violates the laws of the land the person responsible can easily be identified, located and booked. The editor is appointed by the proprietor. The relationship between an editor and a proprietor need not be a smooth one always. We have numerous cases in India where the editor had to step down on account of disagreements with the proprietors. In some cases the proprietors have unceremoniously kicked out the editors. Legendary Malayalam editor Swadeshabhimani Ramakrishna Pilla had left the editorship of many newspapers on account of disagreements with the proprietors. Some people hold the view that an editor is responsible solely to his/her conscience and to the readers. Interference on the editorial policy or on the discharge of the duties of an editor is considered an assault on the freedom of the press and it should be resisted at any cost. But there are few takers for this view. Some newspapers such as _The Times of India_ have done away with the post of chief editor. Some others such as _The Hindu,_ and _Malayala Manorama_ choose the editor from the family memebers of the proprietors so that they can avoid possible differences of opinion in the editorial matters.

**2. News Editor**

News editor is in charge of the newsroom and his major responsibility is in

the selection of news stories. He/she allocates tasks to news team and instructs reporters on the news angles which are to be highlighted in reports. News editor is directly answerable to the chief editor.

The news editor in consultation with the chief reporter will decide what news stories should be covered and in what detail. As the final authority on the news, he has the power to stop the printing of a newspaper in order to accommodate an important fast-breaking news story. He/she must scan all incoming news and issue directions for appropriate editing. Dummy for the first page is finalised by the news editor. He/she should know the pressure, stress, ordeals and joys of working in the late night as well as the strain of competitive journalism and news operations. 2. **Chief sub-editor**

The senior sub-editor or the chief sub-editor is the captain of the editorial section of the news desk. It is his/her responsibility to see that copies are distributed among the sub-editors and to ensure that copies are edited properly, attractive and meaningful headlines are given and copies are free from libels. The edited copies are handed over to the printing section before the cut-off time.

**4. Sub-editor/copy editor**

The sub-editor also known as copy editor has been described as the midwife to the story and _the unsung hero of a newspaper_. He/she should have a lawyer’s analytical approach and quick-mindedness which enables him/her to understand a story quickly and come to the core of the matter. A sub-editor has to give appropriate headlines and, where necessary, revise and condense the material to suit the available space. These tasks call for a flair for writing and mastery over the language. He/she has to

the noble task of educating and informing the reader about what is happening around them. As in every other profession, specialisation is there in reporting too. Big newspapers have specialists to report political, legal, business, education, crime, sports, films and special events. These reporters write authoritative articles in their specialised areas.

An experienced reporter on being given an assignment asks:

1.  What has happened? That is, what has really happened ---the complete story.
2.  Why (or how) did it happen? That is, what are the explanations.
3.  What does it mean? That is, how to interpret it.
4.  What next? That is, in the light of the present news what is expected to happen next.
5.  What is beneath the surface? That is, to interpret an event.

**Principles of reporting**

Every news story should contain four essential elements-- accuracy, attribution of source, fairness and objectivity. These factors give credibility to a publication and at the same time demonstrate a reporter’s sense of responsibility. **1. Accuracy**

The facts in a story should be correct, down to the minutest detail. A reporter must be precise with every bit of the details of a story. Readers tend to judge a newspaper’s credibility by their own experiences with its record of accuracy. Newsstories with inaccuracies are a sign of a lazy reporter.

**2. Attribution**

Source identification should be as specific as possible. Use the person’s name if possible, not merely a ‘spokesperson’. A reporter should not invent news source or attribute information to such vague quarters like ‘an informed source’, ‘a confidential observer’ etc. The source from which

a story’s information is obtained must be clearly identified. Failure to do so makes a reporter’s story suspect.

**3. Fairness**

News stories should be scrupulously fair in their presentation of information. They should never serve the vested interests of groups or individuals. When a person criticises the behavior or opinion of another in a story, basic fairness requires that a person criticised is given an opportunity to respond.

**4. Objectivity**

Writers should strive to keep their personal opinions out of a news story. In general readers are unable to detect the reporter’s political beliefs, religious affiliations or social attitudes. Every reporter will have his/her personal beliefs, interests, and involvements but these should not be allowed to creep into the story. At times a reporter will cover events that run contrary to those personal concerns. In such cases, the reporter should work harder to achieve evenhandedness. Before a reporter submits a story, read through it one more time and ask: “ Is it accurate?, Does it have a proper attribution?, Is it fair? And is it objective?

**Module II**

**Contents of a Newspaper**

The contents of a newspaper can be broadly classified into four types namely news, features, advertisements and opinion pieces. Opinion pieces such as editorials, columns, letters to the editor, and reviews are views expressed by people within the

that brings in its wake death and destruction etc. are all newsworthy events. **4. Proximity :** Proximity means nearness. An accident that takes place in Thiruvananthapuram is more newsworthy in Kerala than an accident of the same magnitude taking place in Bhubaneshwar. **5. Human interest :** These are news stories which appeal to one’s feelings and emotions. A business millionaire donates a kidney, a twelve-year old girl who

ventures to cross the English Channel, a ragging incident that leads a student to commit suicide etc. are examples of human interest stories. **6. Novelty :** Unusual events, actions or statements that make us stop and shake our heads in wonder or puzzlement are certainly newsworthy. A two-headed calf, a cat that walked 200 km to find its owner, a mother gives birth to five babies in delivery etc. are definitely newsworthy items. **7. Sex :** This is of perennial interest to readers. Solar scandal involving Saritha Nair and allegation of sexual abuse against former Kerala minister Jose Thettayil etc. have occupied front page space in media. **8. Eminence and prominence :** Names make news and bigger names make bigger news. There is an aura of news around prominent personalities. The visits, statements and even the silence of big names can make headlines. **9. Money :** The budget (national, state, municipal) is news; so are levying fresh taxes, fall in commodity prices, salary hikes and economic crises. **10. The power elite** : Stories concerning powerful individuals, organization or institutions will frequently appear in the media. **11. Celebrity values** : Stories concerning people who are already famous. Disproportionate attention given by the media on Sachin Tendulkar, the coverage of Abhishek- Aishwarya marriage, the birth of baby Bachan are examples of celebrity news stories. **12. Miscellaneous values:** The other news values include crime, religion,

humour, weather, food, inventions etc. The news values provide criteria for journalists to decide which stories are newsworthy and which are not. These values enable journalists to decide which stories are major ones and which are relatively insignificant.

**TYPES OF NEWS** News stories can generally be divided into two types namely straight news and interpretative writing. A straight news story gives factual account of what has happened in a simple, direct, clear and accurate manner. _Interpretative news_ stories report events in depth, give all sides of the event, provide background information and put new meaning into the events so that the reader can better understand and appreciate the event. _Straight news_ can be further classified into predictable and unpredictable news. Some news can be predicted or anticipated. Such news should be marked in advance by the Chief Reporter and assigned to reporters. The murder of a politician or a cabinet minister, collapse of a building, terrorist attacks, resignation of a minister, the theft of an idol from a famous temple etc. are incidents that are unpredictable. Some scholars classify news into _hard_ and _soft_ news. Stories that fall in the hard news category report specific, tangible events such as fire, accident and death of a prominent person. News stories that provide explanations, analyses and interpretations are known as soft news.

**PRINCIPLES OF REPORTING** Every news story should contain four essential elements— accuracy, attribution of source, fairness and objectivity. **a. Accuracy** The facts in a story should be correct, down to the minutest detail. A reporter must be precise with every bit of the details of a story. Readers tend to judge a newspaper’s credibility by its record of accuracy. **b. Attribution** Source identification should be as specific as possible. The source from which

importance (inverted pyramid style). A feature follows an entirely different style. A feature writer has more freedom and he/she can freely react to situations, events and people with emotions and imagination Depending upon the content, features can be classified into the following categories. **a. Profiles or Personality Features** Profiles describe interesting people. The people may have overcome a handicap, pursued an unusual career, achieved success or become famous because of their colorful personalities. **b. Historical Features** Historical features commemorate the dates of important events, such as the bombing of Hiroshima, assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, Tsunami tragedy and bombing of World Trade Centre. **c. Adventure Features** Adventure features describe unusual and exciting experiences, perhaps the story of someone who survived an airplane crash, climbed a dangerous mountain, sailed around the world, served in the peace keeping force or fought in a war. **d. Seasonal Features** Feature writers are often assigned topics about seasons and holidays: about Independence Day, teachers’ day, Onam, November 1 and the opening day of schools. **e. Explanatory Features** Explanatory features are also called interpretative features. In these features, the writers provide a more detailed description or explanation of topics in the news **f. Unusual Occupation or Hobby Features** Reporters may write about an occupation because it is dangerous,

highly specialized (cleaning up oil spills) or exciting (personal fitness trainer or a make-up artist to a movie star). They may also pick a boring or exacting job (sorting letters at a post office) that is fulfilling to a physically challenged worker because it allows him or her to earn money and live independently. **g. Personal Experience Features** News stories are usually written in the third person (he, she, it) with reporter being a neutral observer or outsider. Features stories can be written in the first person (I, we) with the journalist appearing in the story. **h. Human Interest Features** These deal with ordinary persons in extraordinary circumstances such as a construction worker winning five crore Onam bumper lottery or extraordinary persons in ordinary circumstances such the Chief Minister held up in traffic jam for three hours. They appeal to the emotions of readers. **3. EDITORIAL** A good editorial is a carefully constructed analytical essay in which the writer explains, interprets and appraises an event or public issue. An editorial provides an opportunity to a newspaper to present its viewpoints on a particular policy, programme or event. It is not the chief editor who writes the daily editorials in newspapers. He/she may do it on very important occasions. Most newspapers have editorial writers who perform the task of writing editorials. These writers should know the newspaper’s policies so as to ensure that the viewpoints expressed in the editorials are not contradictory with such policies. **Types of editorials** The style of writing an editorial differs from newspaper to newspaper. Depending on the topics and significance of the events, editorials can be classified into the following types. **a) Interpretative editorial:** This type of editorial enhances the reader’s knowledge and understanding of an issue. It instructs and

answers to gain more information and understanding. A reporter will have to interview several people while preparing news stories and features. Let us analyse the different types of interviews. 

**a. Interview for getting facts/ News interview** This type of interview is intended to give the reader expert comments and illuminations on a subject from persons directly or indirectly connected with the news item.
**b. Interview for getting opinions/Symposium interviews** A reporter gathers opinions from several persons to convey a general idea about a topic. The interviewees need not be experts on the topic but ordinary citizens. 
**c. Personality interview** Personality interview is conducted to reveal the personality of an individual. The interviewer selects a person who is either a news worthy personality or has become newsworthy because of some awards or achievements. Most reporters begin with an informal talk to establish a rapport with the interviewee. Then, the interviewer can move to a prepared set of questions. Generally questions should be asked at the beginning and difficult questions should be posed towards the end. The interviewer should listen carefully and verify the facts. Most interviews are presented in the question and answer format. A brief biographical sketch is given at the beginning and then the entire interview is reproduced or its excerpts. Another structure of the interview is in the form of a speech story giving important facts and quotes.

6.  **MIDDLE** A write-up that generally appears at the center of the editorial page, below the article and above the letters to the editor in a newspaper is known as middle. It is called so in journalistic jargon because middle is

positioned in between two different types of opinion pieces on the same page. The middle is usually a humorous, entertaining piece of writing. Mostly, it is a satire on unusual experiences or strange political developments. It may either deal with an off-beat or a topical subject or attempt to expose or ridicule certain policy, programme, activity etc. Middles are not mere fun and entertainment; they are also highly thought- provoking.

**7. REVIEW** A review is a critical assessment of an art form or entertainment. A review should provide information, describe the work and express an opinion about it. A review is considered useful by many people. A favourable review usually attract people to the work and the vice versa. In the midst of so many art and entertainment, a critical assessment in the form of a review does a vital service to the audience. Reviewers must write for their readers, not for the authors/directors whose work they are assessing. To do this, they must know who their readers are. Some magazines publish a brief review of a film or book and then give a five star rating (*****excellent, ****good, ***average, **below average, *poor). Some newspapers and magazine provide longer, more carefully argued reviews. A book review in _The Hindu_ and _The Frontline,_ for example, might run to 1,000 words of description, argument and opinion.

### REPORTING PRACTICES

reasons behind the news, the possible solutions, and the future prospectus of the news events and developments.

**Structure of a News Story** A news story is organized differently from any other type of writing. For example, an essay would begin with an introduction and then move on to the body and then end with a powerful conclusion. But a news story quickly conveys the main facts of a happening – the climax – and then relates the other facts in the order of diminishing importance.

The main advantage of this type of writing is that it is easy to grasp the important points in the first few seconds of the reading. Let us analyse a typical story in a newspaper.

**Abdul Ghani Lone shot dead Srinagar, May 21** (UNI): Senior Hurriyat Conference leader Abdul Ghani Lone was today shot dead by unidentified gunmen at a rally here, dealing a severe blow to the voice of moderates among separatists. One of Lone’s gunmen was also killed in the attack while another injured, they said. The shootout took place during a ceremony to mark the death anniversary of the father of senior Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and former Mirwaiz of Kashmir, Maulvi Mohammed Farooq, at Idgah ground in Old Srinagar city, they said. The attack was apparently carried out by two unidentified gunmen who appeared at the Idgah graveyard.... ( _The New Indian Express_ , Kozhikode)

**Abdul Ghani Lone shot dead** which appears in bold type is the headline. It is put at the head of the story and gives the reader an idea about the subject of the story. _Srinagar, May 21_ is the ‘dateline’. It tells the reader the place and date of the

news story. UNI is the ‘creditline’. The newspaper has published this story which has been supplied by the news agency _United News of India_. By putting UNI the paper acknowledges the source of the news story and gives due credit. Sometimes the name of the reporter or correspondent appears below the headline: for example, _From John Mary, By K K Katyal_ etc. It is termed byline in newspaper jargon. The first paragraph of the story is called intro or lead. In the above example _Senior Hurriyat Conference leader Abdul Ghani Lone was today shot dead by unidentified gunmen at a rally here, dealing a severe blow to the voice of moderates among separatists_ is the intro/lead. The rest of the news is called the _body_ of the news story. Intro/lead gives the most important information contained in the news story. A well written lead/ intro is a prerequisite of a good story.

**Inverted pyramid style**

Newspapers also adopted the inverted-pyramid form because it summarises the news quickly. It gives readers the convenience of grasping the news of the day by simply skimming lead paragraphs. The form allows readers to decide whether they want to continue reading a story or leave it after any one of its paragraphs. An inverted pyramid can also be trimmed from the bottom, which makes it easier to fit it into the tight news holes of a newspaper. The primary **advantage** of the inverted pyramid style is that it allows someone to stop reading a story after only one or two paragraph. Doing so still allows that person to learn the story’s most important details. The inverted pyramid style also ensures that all the facts are immediately understandable. It also helps the

## Organizational structure of a newspaper

**Journalism is not concerned only with writing and editing of newspaper**

**and periodicals. The gathering and transmission of news, business management, advertising and other processes connected with the**

**production of a newspaper also come under the purview of journalism. The**

**organizational set-up varies from newspaper to newspaper depending upon the size of the newspaper and the different services catered for the**

**readers. Generally speaking, most of the newspapers have three main**

**departments- editorial, business and mechanical.**

### Editorial wing

**The editorial/news department is the heart of a newspaper. It deals with news, features, comments, columns and editorials. At the head of the**

**department is the editor or editor-in-chief. The editor is assisted by the**

**city editor, or chief reporter who has a team of reporters to cover the local events. In some newspapers, there are separate desks for national and**

**foreign news, which are fed by new agencies and also by papers own**

**correspondents. The editor is also assisted by critics in special fields such as theatre, music, films, etc. One important desk and its functionary head,**

**i., the copy editor edits the copy and writes headlines.**

**The editor of a small newspaper combines in himself almost all the**

**functions, i., gathering, editing and printing of news. He also solicits advertisements and look after the business side of the paper.**

**Business department**

**The second important department in a newspaper is the business department, which earns revenue for the newspaper. It is divided into two**

**main division- advertising and circulation.**

**The advertisement department may have further sub-divisions such as advertisements for local display, classified advertisements etc. It may also**

**have a research bureau and an art section to help in the preparation of**

**advertisements. The circulation department deals with the dispatch of copies to the city and beyond the city through road, rail and air. It may**

**also have a promotional wing to boost up the circulation of the paper.**

**Mechanical department**

**The mechanical department generally is divided into four parts-**

**composing, engraving, stereotyping and press. In the first, the copy is set**

**into type. The engraving wing is concerned with photos and drawings and**

**makes cuts for printing. In the stereotyping room, the plates for the press**

**are cast in the molten metal from the page form. The papers are printed,**

**folded, trimmed, counted and delivered to the mailing section by the press room.**

**The bigger newspapers have also separated administrative or**

**coordinating as well as promotional departments. The administrative department looks after administration of different departments while the**

**promotional department deals with all the promotional work in respect of**

**advertisements and circulation.**

### STRUCTURE OF THE EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT

**At top the editorial hierarchy ranks the editor or an editor- in- chief who plans and directs the day to day operations, supported by a team of news**

**editors, chief sub editors, senior sub editors and sub editors. The news**

**desk usually operates in shift and each shift is headed by a chief sub, also called as ‘slot man’. Ideally in a newspaper, it is the news editor who plans**

**and directs page making while the chief sub helps implement his**

**decisions. Reporters and sub editors are the pillars of organizational hierarchy. The chief reporter supervises the bureau while the chief sub**

**editor supervises the desk. The hierarchy of authority in the reporting and**

**editing section is given below.**

**Editor**

**The editor holds the key position in the newspaper organization. He is**

**responsible for the editorial content of the newspaper including**

**everything from comics to news stories to editorials. It is the editor who can be sued for libel, who can be hauled up before Court, Parliament and**

**legislatures for contempt.**

**A good editor of a newspaper is aware of the scope and interpretation of news. He takes all important decisions connected with the publication of**

**news and expression of opinion on vital national and international issues**

**and events.**

**News editor**

**The actual news production process is handled by the news editor in a**

**newspaper. All major decisions regarding coverage of news stories are**

**Chief Sub- Editor** is the person who directs and supervises the editorial side of the newspaper. The primary role of the editor is: •To manage the newspaper. •Determines whether a submitted manuscript is appropriate for publishing. •S e l e c t s e x p e r t r e v i e w e r s a n d a n a r e a e d i t o r t o e v al u a t e t h e s u b m i t t e d manuscript. •R e n d e r s a fi n a l e d i t o r i a l d e c i s i o n o n e a c h m a n u s c r ip t b a s e d o n t h e recommendation, journal priorities, other similar manuscripts in process and related considerations. •Communicates directly with the author and the review team. •Schedule accepted manuscripts for publication.

#### SUB EDITORS

They are responsible for ensuring that the tone, style and layout of final copymatch the publication's house style and target market.

The role involves processing all the copy before it is published to ensure that it isaccurate, makes sense and reads well. They also lay out the story on the page andmay also be involved with overall page design with many roles in journalism, sub-editing is a demanding role that requiresconstant attention to detail within a fast-paced working environment activities vary and can depend on the extent to which production and layoutwork falls within a sub-editor's remit. Only senior sub-editors would be expected tohave much legal knowledge.

Common activities that form much of the work of most Sub-Editors include:

•Editing copy to remove spelling mistakes and grammatical errors; •Rewriting material so that it flows or reads better and adheres to the housestyle of a particular publication; •Ensuring that a story fits a particular word count by cutting or expandingmaterial as necessary; •Wr i t i n g h e a d l i n e s t h a t c a p t u re t h e e s s e n c e o f t h e s t o r y o r a r e c l e v e r o r amusing; •Writing stand-firsts (brief introductions which sum up the story); •L i a i s i n g w i t h re p o r t e r s o r j o u rn a l i s t s t o c l a r i f y f a c t s a n d d e t a i l s a b o u t a story; •Editing press releases or reports; •Compiling routine information, such as tables of sports results or financial data; •C h e c k i n g s t o r i e s t o e n s u r e t h e y a r e a c c u r a t e , d o no t b r e a k t h e l a w o r g o against the publication's policy; •Cropping photos and deciding where to use them for best effect; •Writing the captions for pictures;

•Discussing concerns with editors; •Proofreading complete pages produced by other sub-editors; •Working to a page plan to ensure that the right stories appear in the correct place on each page; •Laying out pages and, depending on the nature of the role, playing a part in page design; •Adding last minute news stories; •Keeping up to date with sector issues, e. by reading related publications

#### EDITING -INTRODUCTION

**Editing is the process of preparing language, images or sound for presentation through correction, condensation, organization and other modification. Editing is a responsibility shared by many people on a newspaper. It begins whena reporter polishes a story before turning it in. it ends when final errors are corrected just before the edition goes to press. Between these events the sub-editors practice their art of editing**

**Copy editing is the process by which an editor makes formatting changes and other improvements to the text. A person who performs the task of copy editing is called a copy editor. A copy editor mostly reviews and edits reporters copy for accuracy, content, grammar and style. They also provide catchy headlines for the story. The following tasks are their responsibilities

1.  Ensuring accuracy
2.  Trimming unnecessary words
3.  Polishing the language
4.  Correcting inconsistencies
5.  Making the story conform to style and editorial policy
6.  Eliminating passages in poor taste
7.  Eliminating libelous statements
8.  Making certain the story is readable and complete.**

**Editing process**

  •Give the main points of the news in the first paragraph •Tell the story in headline and use a verb to give it vigor •C h e c k n a m e s , t i t l e s , f a c t s , fi g u r e s , d a t e s , a n d a d dr e s s w h e r e e v e r slightest doubt exists. The sub-editor know the reference book which willclear the doubt •Both sides of the story in a dispute must be given •Use short sentences and short paragraphs •Re p e a t n a m e s i n c o u r t c a s e s r a t h e r t h a n r e f e r t o th e m a s a c c u s e d , witness, etc •I n d i c a t e c o r r e c t n e s s o f d o u b t f u l s p e l l i n g b y s a y i ng ‘ c o r r e c t ’ w i t h i n brackets •Beware of foreign names •Define long, unfamiliar words, especially scientific and medical terms •Do not begin sentences with words like ‘despite’ or ‘because’ •Do not use vague phrases like a ‘ serous charge’ or a ‘certain offence’ •Reporters to give a rather artificial flow to the story ‘meanwhile’ oftenuse the word. Cut it out •Use concrete words, words that make the reader see, hear, smell or taste. Test the story for concrete images and visual word pictures •Be careful about pronouns. The misuse of the relative pronoun and punctuation are the most common grammatical errors in the news stories. •E d i t o r i a l i z i n g a n y t r a c e o f p e r s o n a l o p i n i o n o r a v a l u e j u d g m e n t sh ould be eliminated from the copy unless it is a feature or news analysis

**News Headline**

Simplicity, informality and impact are the essential characteristics of a modern headline. It should give clear signal about the content of the story and should be economical in editorial production and reading time and in news space. It should be read quickly. It should be proportionate to the news and flexible.

**Headline pattern** Headlines can be multi deck or multiline in a single deck. **A deck** is a distinct headline on its own and as such it may consist of one or more lines. If there are two such units, say of two lines each; the headline will be double deck.

Modern school of thought is against the multi deck. The argument is that multi deck headlines consume more editorial time in writing, production time in setting and the newsprint space.

Peoplenormally don’t bother to read beyond the main heading. In most newspapers one to two top stories on a page are multi deck. One should not go beyond three decks even in such stories.

There is a wide range of possibilities regarding arrangement of headlines. The basic typographic arrangements are **flush left, centered, stepped, flush right and hanging indention**.

**Flush left** : Many newspapers have switched to this style. The flush left heading has one ore more lines which are set flush to the left. **Centered:** In this type of arrangement each line of headline type is centered on the white of the column. **Stepped** : In this arrangement the first line is set flush left and the last flush right and the middle lines centered. **Flush right:** Each line is pushed against the right hand margin to create a stepped effect on the left. **Hanging indention** : The first line is set full out and the others indented usually to the left. It cannot be a regular style but can be used as an occasional variant. **Banner Headline** : A newspaper headline written in large letters across the widthof the page. When the heading is given below the nameplate of the newspaper andcovers all columns from left to right, it is called **banner headline.** Some may callit streamer, which also covers the entire column but is normally given on the inside page. Sometimes the streamer may leave one column.

**Skyline:** for very exceptional and exclusive events, the headline of the story issometimes given over the nameplate of the newspaper. It means that the event iseven more important than the authority of the newspaper.

**Writing headlines** Writing headlines involves half the skill of a good deskman. The difficulty in writing headlines is in conveying in a few attractive words the essence of a complicated set of facts. In half a dozen words the headline has to inform the reader what the story contains. The headline gives emphasis to a few words in bold types. Hence every word should be weighed.

Headline writing is art and craft at the same time. The art is in imagination and vocabulary and the craft lies in accuracy of content, attractiveness of appearance and practicality

It can make a promise for some big benefit, it can make an offer, it can challenge the reader in some way, it can introduce some really compelling concept or idea, or it can be something newsworthy.

Newspapers sell news and headlines are a means to attract the readers towards thenews items. For a page designer, each headline is a new and unique challenge.

#### PRODUCTION PROCESS

Once the news is identified, it is reported by the field staff and edited by those in the desk. Next starts the production stage. The first step in this phase is newspaper design. In some newspaper firms, sub editors themselves design pages; in others layout artists do the job. With the Desk Top Publishing (DTP), it has been easy for any computer literate to design newspaper pages. QuarkExpress and Adobe InDesign are the commonly used software for page design in Indian newspapers. Pages are set according to the dummy, a skeleton of the newspaper page, given by the advertising department after marking the space for advertisements of the day. Designer/Sub Editor arranges news stories and news photos on the pages according to their importance. To make the pages visually attractive, pages are arranged keeping

 **Symmetry : Visual balance of the text and graphics**  **Colour balance : Visual balance of the various color used.**

 **Judicious use of white space : To provide enough white space to avoid messy design**  **Readability criteria : To make the page functionally readable**  **Legibility : Clarity and visibility of the text and graphics**  **Consistency : Standardization of the design for newspaper branding**  **House style: Standards devised by each newspaper organization should be followed in design.** Now, the page is ready. It is handed over to senior editors like chief sub editor, news editor, assistant editor or any such supervising staff for scrutiny and approval. After the approval, the pages will go to plate making section. Earlier the plates were made after filming the pages. But, advances in technology help skip this step. Now, pages can be directly transferred to plates (Plates are aluminum sheets on which images of the pages are printed using special chemicals). These plates are mounted on to printing machines for printing. Printed newspapers are packed for transportation to the newspaper agents. In a newspaper organization, every task has a time limit. Otherwise, we will not get newspapers early morning everyday. The time limit for completing an assignment is called deadline. Very good internal communication is essential for better function of a newspaper organization. Reporters should inform what is up there in the field. Editors should inform each other about the stories allotted to each page. Designer should consult with the sub editor about arranging news on a page and with the printer about the technicalities of printing. Advertising department should give advertisement details on time and marketing section should inform the editorial section about the market needs. In short, everybody should go hand in hand for successful functioning of a newspaper organization.

**Newspaper Design and Layout**

It is essential to realize that newspaper design is part of journalism. It is not decoration but

communication. Newspaper communicates news and ideas and design is an integral part of the

process.

It is the function of newspaper design to present that mosaic in an organized and

comprehensive way by using text type, display type, photography, line work, white space and a

sequence of pages in the most fitting combination.

Layout means arrangement of headlines, text, artwork and white space on a page or pages.

the display. There should be order but prime importance should be given to news values.

"Newspaper makeup" is defined as the design of a newspaper page or the manner in which pictures, headlines and news stories are arranged on a page. The objectives of newspaper makeup areas follows: i. To indicate the importance of the news ii. To make the page easy to read iii. To make the page attractive It consists the arrangement of illustrations, texts and graphics on a page which is to be printed including the selection of font styles, sizes and colors.

 Laying out a page is a matter of personal taste. There are no criteria set for it. Therefore, the staff may experiment freely on page makeup until they get the pattern acceptable to them  Layout does so much good to a newspaper because it gives prominence to the news in proportion to its importance  It makes the pages appear attractive  It makes the different contents easy to find and read.It gives the paper a personality/individuality of its own  Boxes for pictures, arrows for texts and lines for leads are among the symbols used in layouting.

A newspaper should be carefully and properly laid out **i.** To give prominence to the news in proportion to is importance. **ii.** To make the different contents easy to find and to read **iii.** To give the pages an attractive appearance **iv.** To give the paper a personality of its own.

#### FACTORS OF A GOOD LAYOUT

**1.** Proportion - deals with the ratio of one part to another and of the parts to the whole. Example: Pictures must be sized properly to keep up with other shapes on the page

 Pictures must be sized properly to keep up with other shapes on the page.  Length of stories must be considered.  A long story may ruin the proportion of the page.  A jump story is better than a poorly proportioned page.

**2.** Unity (Harmony) - the agreement between parts. Content of every page/double page must blend as a harmonious unit. No one part of the page

**1.** Perfect Balance Makeup (Balance or Symmetrical Makeup) – A large headline placed, for example in the right-hand column front page, is balanced with a corresponding large one in the first and second column. -Other headlines are similarly arranged. A one-column cut at the top of the column four. This kind of makeup gives a static, monotonous appearance to the paper. New York Times is noted for this.

**2.** Brace or Focus Makeup -Headlines are diagonally arranged from the upper left to the lower right hand corner or vice-versa just like a brace supporting a house. -balance is obtained by various devices such as two column heads, boxes, and cuts which are used to offset the weight concentrated in the upper right or upper left hand corner. This kind of makeup is desirable to use when one story is more important than any other because the reader’s attention is directed to the upper right-hand corner or occasionally to the upper left.

**3.** Contrast and Balance Makeup-This type groups are arranged at varying distances from the center like two boys on a see- saw. It is sometimes called occult or hidden balance because the type groups with its headline may be balanced with a picture, an illustration, or a box., or instead of a type group. No attempt is made to achieve perfect balance. This is one of the most popular kinds of front page makeup since it permits great variety from issue to issue.

**4.** Broken Column Makeup -the page is broken into several units to give space to many stories. -symmetry is obtained be carefully arranging the contents so as not to cancel each other by their nearness. Large heads and cuts are placed where they give the page a pleasing pattern. This kind of makeup is developed primarily to be able to print as many short news stories on Page 1 as possible.

**5.** Occult Makeup -type groups are arranged at varying distances from the center like two boys on a see-saw. -it is sometimes called occult or hidden balance because the type group with its headline may be balanced with a picture, an illustration or a bow instead of another type group. ,

**6.** Streamline Makeup -the format is similar to that of the contrast and balance makeup. However the nameplate is , usually floated, headlines are flushed up in cap and lower-case (clc) type, and large body types are often used. -instead of boxing stories in full, three quarter boxes are restored to. Often, bullets, asterisks, or jim dashes are employed to introduce lead stories. This kind of makeup is more commonly used by high school papers than by the national dailies.

**7.** Circus Makeup - it is broken-column carried to the extreme. The page is broken up with no attempt at regularity symmetry or order , ,. -Many headlines of all size; boxes and cuts are scattered all over the page, each clamoring for attention, and screaming as barkers carnival circus do. There is no focus of interest.

**Makeup By Way of Text and Photo Combination**

1.  The X Format
2.  The Curve Format
3.  The L format
4.  The J Format
5.  The Umbrella Format

**Types of Layouting**

1.  Quadrant Makeup - divides the page into four parts. Each quarter has its own eye-spotting story.
2.  Horizontal Makeup -the appearance of the page is horizontal rectangles. The effect on the eyes is made by using multi-column heads; the eyesight travels horizontally.
3.  Circus Makeup - which is really like a circus. All harmony is thrown to the winds. No symmetry, and there are sensational pictures or boxed human interest stories.
4.  Brace Makeup the brace is characterized by angular shelf-like arrangement of content. The deskman usually projects the effect by making a four-column head, that is what you call a red-out or a drop-head of, two columns or three- columns.

**Make up of Inside Pages**  For News PagesInside news pages should be laid as facing page units rather than as single pages. The principles of contrast and balance used for front page makeup should also be applied in planning the makeup of facing pages  For Editorial Pages These pages should have a distinctive, dignified, and formal appearance. The masthead or editorial box which should be relatively small, may be anchored in any corner as done in streamlined newspapers.  The editorial page is one place in the newspaper where opinion is not only permissible but encouraged  Traditionally the editorials appear in , the first two columns. They are of larger types. Heads or titles of editorials, just like the headline of news stories should be of the masculine appearance, not the italic or the script type.  The editorial page is dominated by comment and analysis rather than objective reporting of factual information  For Feature and Literary Pages These pages must have a literary and feminine appearance. The columns are often wider Roman and italics types are. used for text.
