It's \nsomewhat the sum of all my knowledge. Constantly evolving, changing, and morphing. \n\nThis contains (or will contain) a lot of resources, my thoughts and opinion on a lot of things, some reflections, about philosophies, concepts that have really changed my life, and maybe even rants. \n\nYou'll find writings of all kinds here; Psychology, Epistemology, Politics, Tech, and everything under the sun.  You will also find a lot of broken links and dead-ends or stub articles. It's a work in progress, perpetually. \n \nSome things here might not apply to you, might be wrong, or straight up silly. I'd love to hear your opinions, though! Leave a message on the chatbox on my site. I'm adding more ways to contact me, and also a discussion page on this site. \n\n### Why?\n- Everything is linked; to find links between seemingly unrelated things - even if the links are meaningless and are a result of correlation and nothing more\n- A **personal wiki** for me. You know how you want to pull up a particular study, or a particular statistic, or something else to win an argument but good ole tip-of-the-tongue syndrome hits? No? Just me? Okay. . . \n- To preserve knowledge and archive things interesting to me\n- To reflect and ponder, to welcome change instead of resist it. To revisit concepts and re-examine my views. \n- To make sure it's available to everyone \n- Zettelkasten Method (heavily inspired, loosely implemented)\n- To find how many times I refer to a topic, concept or even a phrase! \n- To reflect on and remember what I've learnt \n\n\n[^codex]: A Codex vitae is a 'living document'.

It won't see the light of day again just like it's predessors. They are all immaculate works of art, so immaculate that the mere eye isn't equipped to apppreciate the truth that lies in between every space left blank and the lies in every space filled in. They are spmething which you would say are for my eyes only. Every step from the outlining, the mapping out, to the final touches are observed by me and only me. They lie hidden under the piece of muslin when they lie dormant. Such beauty deserves to be shielded.protected.adored. cara mia. \nAlthough, I must proclaim that I've grown an unlikely affection towards my work in progress. Afterall, it is a potrait of the most brilliant woman to ever exist. Me. But ever since I've started it, I have been having peculiar dreams. It feels as though it is real. It maps ou my regular routine. I wake up, I paint, and I go to sleep. until I am awaken by a pang in my chest. I am drawn to my art room. I look at my painting and as soon as I meet her eyes, oh my dear dear love, the illusion shatters and I am brought back into reality. But strangely, I find myself in my art room, the muslin still covering my portrait. I begin to wonder if the entire endevour was a dream or if only a fragment of it was an illlusion. Had I begun sleep walking again? I'm starting to forget what day it is. Had I already coloured in the eyes? they seem fuller than before. They seem to be straing into mine. Just like...just like the dream. I'm almost envious of her. Her porcelin skin, her bright eyes, blonde hair and blush lips. Much of my youthfullness had faded making this painting. I had earned many sleepless nights. How many days had it been again/ There goes another hair, greying, falling unto my skirt. I fear she is judging me. I cover her up. I think I am going mad. The muslin ws right there a moment ago. I could have sworn it was. It has vanished. The lady is staring at me again. I think she wants to be free. But oh, Cara Mia, how will you understand noone will appreciate your eloquence and haunting beauty as I do? The eyes drip of paint, almost as though they are wailing. soon the whole portrait starts to fade and pour. I rush in a pathetic attempt to stop it. It does not work. I am left abandoned. alone. I am afraid I will forget what I look like without her as proof. But on the other hand, I am glad she is more free than I could ever be.

A pale, boring 90 minute distillation of 299 pages. Something a 10 minute summary does a better job of.  \n\n# About \nAuthor: James Joyce\n[[Stream of consciousness]] \n[[Modernist]]\nsemi-autobiographical \ncoming of age\ninner conflict\n\n\n# Summary - Key Events\nStephen Dedalus - as a kid- goes to hostel - is asked by his father not to snitch on anyone - he gets pushed into a ditch - does NOT snitch - while asleep he overhears a conversation -\u003e\n\tabout Parnell (Irish politician, not ficitional) - how he fell due to his sins - adultery (lust) and pride  \n\n**Christmas Dinner** Dedalus goes back home - argument about politics erupts- Simon and Mr Casey (Simon's friend) discuss how the Catholic church should not meddle in politics. **Dante** disagrees. Says its catholics' duty to follow whatever the priests and bishops say without questioning; even if they are opposed to the Irish cause. Says she will defend her religion against \"renegade catholics\" \nMr Casey tells a story - how an old Catholic woman talked ill about Parnell and the woman he cheated with. Mr Casey upon hearing their names bemirched, on hearing the words she used, spits his tobacco juice on her face. The men laugh. Dante is infuriated, calls Mr Casey a blasphemer, and repeatedly says \"may they devil be on you\"\n\n**Secularists vs Orthodox**\n\n**Back to school**\nWe see how the kids are flogged in Catholic school. Dedalus gets flogged because Father Dolan thinks he's being an \"idle loafer\" who isn't working though he can't work due to his glasses being broken. He goes and tells the rector about what Father Dolan did. His classmates hoist him over their heads and celebrate him as a hero.\nThough this happens, Dedalus still feels alone once the wave is gone. He realizes that being a hero will not reduce his \"outsider\"ness or end his loneliness. After meeting the rector, he goes home to get a new pair of glasses. \n\nThe Dedaluses become bankrupt, have to move, and their properties are auctioned off. Stephen and Simon attend it. Simon imparts advice, tells Stephen to associate w gentemen, how all of his friends were good at one thing or the other. He emphasises on how they were truthful \n\nDedalus wins the national essay and is rewarded w money. When his essay is being read, a \"lewd\" picture is being passed along. Uses the money at a brothel. \n\nFather Parnall delivers a speech about hell. About how awful it is. \n\"Fire in hell gives no light\" , bodies stacked upon each other, no space, corpses rotting, putrid stench, millions of carcasses, \ntorment of fire is the worst thing they're subjected to. Fire of Hell was created by God to punish. It preserves what it burns. It burns at the highest intensity. \"Time is time was. Time shall be no more\". Talks about temptation and giving into them. **Stephen is scared.**  He gets nightmares and throws up. \n\nStephen confesses. He tells the father he has slept with prostitutes. And he has impure thoughts. He is asked to not \"offend God again\"  and give up the wretched sin. Pray to Mother Mary when the temptations come. \n\nCalling of God. Promised \"awful\" powers if he becomes a priest. More than any angel or archangel.  \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.489278868Z","tags":null},"/Advice-to-Youth":{"title":"Advice to Youth - Mark Twain","content":"\nAdvice given to youth by [[Mark Twain]], fam\n\n1.

Researchers at Wake Forest University found that **trans fats**, which are created by partially hydrogenated oil, increase the amount of fat around the belly and redistribute fat tissue to the abdomen from other parts of the body. Trans fats may be found in such foods as margarine, pastries, cookies, crackers, and fried and convenience foods.\n2. Visceral fat == dangerous\n3. **verify** - *Extended fasting activates autophagy which clears out misfolded proteins and senescent cells in the entire body. HGH and NAD+ are upregulated. It selects for beneficial gut bacteria that not only do less damage to your digestive tract, but also drive healthy behavior via the gut-brain axis. Then you get into the insane mismatch of the promotion of maintenance of steady blood sugar via constant eating and our actual evolutionary history and the concomitant devastation that has on metabolic health.*\n4. **SLEEP IS IMPORTANT**\n5. **Check if strength training thing is true** We lose **muscle mass as we age**. Strength training, such as lifting weights helps us build muscle. Muscles use up more energy and therefore burn more calories. \n   ***Weight training builds muscle, and muscle burns more calories than fat-up to three times more. \"So the more muscle you have, the more calories you're going to burn. It doesn't end after you leave the gym either. Your body is still torching calories for the next 24 to 48 hours as it works to repair stressed muscle tissues. That's known as the afterburn effect, another name for excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). The more oxygen you use both during and after a workout, the greater the EPOC. And studies show strength training is one of the best ways to do it.***\n   6. Cut down on **refined** products. Whole grain \u003e\u003e\u003e\n   7. Add more fiber\n   8. Vitamins and minerals\n   9. Cutting calories and getting more physical activity is the best way\n   10. Focus on healthy protein sources. “Protein keeps you fuller longer, and helps you avoid spikes in blood sugar that come from all-carbohydrate meals,” Srinath says. “For example, if you like oatmeal for breakfast, add some nuts or peanut butter to it for protein.”\n   11. 3 hours of break is required between dinner and sleep\n   12.

The night of that theatrical  \nperformance was his last chance to see that the audience stay  \nawake the entire night while watching his play. We hear  \nauthor-narrator‟s repeated laments,  \n“I may be dead within the next few hours.”  \nMythical elements can be seen in the second and the third  \nnarrative level. The author-narrator meets the host of the  \ngiggling flames, each one carrying her own story becomes the  \nsecond story. These personified flames go to the same ruined  \ntemple where the author-narrator is bewailing his plight.  \nOn the third level, we find a tale by a flame, who wants to be  \nforgiven for arriving late to the hosting place. The tale is about  \nan old woman who knew an interesting story but refused to  \nshare it with others. Ironically, that story slipped out of the  \nsnoring old hag‟s mouth and is transformed into a beautiful  \nyoung lady and the song that accompanies it, turns into a  \nbeautiful sari.\nThus, the fourth narrative level is the story of Rani, the lady  \nwho born out of the story from the old hag‟s mouth. Rani  \nbecomes the main character of the play Nagamandala.

They don't live long. No queen means no males.\nWhat's interesting is societal roles of ants within the colony. Each any has a specific role within the colony. These would appear to be a collective of foragers. They ate either all from the same colony or they are Argentine ants. Ants produce pheromones. Most ants if the same species but of different colonies will fight and kill each other. Argentine ants are the only known species that don't do this and we don't know why. In theory, all Argentine ants form a single colony which would be insane because they are found on multiple continents.\nAnts death spirals exist so this single instance of these ants operating without a queen is the only known example of this behavior in ants in the entire world, as to my knowledge. I'm an exterminator just shy of a decade in the industry. I have no degree in entomology, so there are many much more knowledgeable folks than myself.\nTermite colonies have complex climate control that includes bringing moisture with them wherever the colony expands.\nSolitary wasps produce no known allergens.\nWolf spider and yellow sack spider bite can cause necrosis if the person bitten reacts badly. Not as bad as a brown recluse bite, but still, necrosis is necrosis.\nDelusional parasitosis, forgive my spelling, is very real and surprisingly common.\nLice prefer clean hair over dirty hair.\nBedbugs have sex organs but typically breed by the male literally just stabbing a female with his spike like penis in a process called traumatic insemination and a theory as to why bedbugs spread in the manner that they do could suggest its the females trying to get away from the males.\"*  \n\n*\"Simply, interesting facts about a variety if insects that most people don't know.\nI've forgotten more about insects than most will learn in a lifetime. I can talk for hours about pest control. I'd say the majority of exterminators that have more than a few years in can do the same. We don't bring it up unless asked. Most people don't have a clue as RI the extensive knowledge their exterminator actually has. The majority of what we do is simply maintence.\nThe insect world is vast. There are so many different insects even regionally, not to mentioned rarity of various species. I dont come across many new insects anymore, the ones I do happen to be very rare in my region. At this point, the things that surprise me tend to be new places I've found bugs. I've seen ant colony is working and running aquarium aerators. I found a colony living underneath the glass of an aquarium. They were almost completely contained living along the exterior. They collected food from spilled fish food, moisture from condensate off the glass as well as moisture from the tank itself. I had my suspicions on bedbugs feeding off creatures other than humans before the science suggested it was possible, through my own observations. I had a really bad bedbug job, possibly the worst one I've ever seen. I found them living in a bird cage and 2 pet carriers for dogs. Until this point, the science said they didn't do that. There is something called a bat bug that looks damn near identical to a bedbug that feeds off of bats. We know they will take a blood meal off of humans but require bat blood to reproduce and complete their stage changes. Seemed to me that despite what the science said, in a similar situation, bedbugs could take a blood meal from a different source, but still require human blood to reproduce and also complete their stage changes. I found a type of solitary Prarie bee that prefers a specific soil composition to build their nest. An entire half acre plot land with a hole about every square inch. Thousands of these things took over these peoples yard. They run for about 6 weeks in the spring. I had one and another tech had one at the same time in a different location. I've only ever seen this once and I've never seen anything quite like it. Cicada killers behave in a similar manner, they also run about 6 weeks in my region, just in late summer, but you never see those kinds of number. 30 in a yard is a lot. I ended up calling the Perdue University Department of Entomology amd spoke with a grad student working on a PH.D. The gentleman ended up doing some quick research for me and found a paper written by someone with a Doctorates in Entomology about having the same issues in his garden. Absolutely fascinating stuff, and begged me not to kill them as loss of habitat has forced them into situations like this. They aren't endangered yet, but they are in that path. I explained the situation to the home owner and gave them some other compromised solutions that they decided to try. I told them I would kill them if they truly wanted me to, but they would come back. The solution is changing the soil composition, they ended up mulching an area for the kids and dogs to play in and let the bee have their 6 weeks with the rest of the yard. That one left me all warm and fuzzy. It's not often we get to find a solution like that. The bees were happy the homeowner was happy.\nIf you want to know about all the insect and insect eggs you eat on a daily basis, message me. Those discussions tend to freak people out. I warn you, I will tell you what I know about this stuff if you really want to know it but you won't look at a variety of foods the same.\nI can also tell you how to inspect second hand furniture for cockroaches and bedbugs before purchase. I can walk you through bedbug inspections for hotel rooms. I can tell you what to look for in restaurants. I can tell you which over the counter pesticides and rodenticides work and don't work. I can discuss, in depth and detail the behavioral patterns of a variety of pests, mice and rats included, which will typically increase the number you kill with snap traps and catch with glue boards.\nI can tell you vibrators are susceptible to bedbug infestation. I can tell you the dumb shit people think will work to combat their pest issues. I can also discuss the pros and cons of 25(b) exempt products (essential oil pesticides) I can tell you organic foods are still sprayed with pesticides, just not synthetic pesticides.\nThis is a wonderful tip. On chemical labels, they list the what to do of this happens from top to bottom by severity. Bleach labels always have what to do if swallowed at the top of the list.

Le Guin's The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction, 1986**\n\n---\nIn the temperate and tropical regions where it appears that hominids evolved into human beings, the principal food of the species was vegetable. Sixty-five to eighty percent of what human beings ate in those regions in Paleolithic, Neolithic, and prehistoric times was gathered; only in the extreme Arctic was meat the staple food. The mammoth hunters spectacularly occupy the cave wall and the mind, but what we actually did to stay alive and fat was gather seeds, roots, sprouts, shoots, leaves, nuts, berries, fruits, and grains, adding bugs and mollusks and netting or snaring birds, fish, rats, rabbits, and other tuskless small fry to up the protein. And we didn’t even work hard at it — much less hard than peasants slaving in somebody else’s field after agriculture was invented, much less hard than paid workers since civilization was invented. The average prehistoric person could make a nice living in about a fifteen-hour work week.\n\nFifteen hours a week for subsistence leaves a lot of time for other things. So much time that maybe the restless ones who didn’t have a baby around to enliven their life, or skill in making or cooking or singing, or very interesting thoughts to think, decided to slope off and hunt mammoths. The skillful hunters would come staggering back with a load of meat, a lot of ivory, and a story. It wasn’t the meat that made the difference. It was the story.\n\nIt is hard to tell a really gripping tale of how I wrestled a wild-oat seed from its husk, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then I scratched my gnat bites, and Ool said something funny, and we went to the creek and got a drink and watched newts for a while, and then I found another patch of oats.... No, it does not compare, it cannot compete with how I thrust my spear deep into the titanic hairy flank while Oob, impaled on one huge sweeping tusk, writhed screaming, and blood sprouted everywhere in crimson torrents, and Boob was crushed to jelly when the mammoth fell on him as I shot my unerring arrow straight through eye to brain.\n\nThat story not only has Action, it has a Hero. Heroes are powerful. Before you know it, the men and women in the wild-oat patch and their kids and the skills of makers and the thoughts of the thoughtful and the songs of the singers are all part of it, have all been pressed into service in the tale of the Hero. But it isn’t their story. It’s his.\n\nWhen she was planning the book that ended up as _Three Guineas_, Virginia Woolf wrote a heading in her notebook, “Glossary”; she had thought of reinventing English according to her new plan, in order to tell a different story. One of the entries in this glossary is _heroism_, defined as “botulism.” And _hero_, in Woolf’s dictionary, is “bottle.” The hero as bottle, a stringent reevaluation. I now propose the bottle as hero.\n\nNot just the bottle of gin or wine, but bottle in its older sense of container in general, a thing that holds something else.\n\nIf you haven’t got something to put it in, food will escape you — even something as uncombative and unresourceful as an oat. You put as many as you can into your stomach while they are handy, that being the primary container; but what about tomorrow morning when you wake up and it’s cold and raining and wouldn’t it be good to have just a few handfuls of oats to chew on and give little Oom to make her shut up, but how do you get more than one stomachful and one handful home? So you get up and go to the damned soggy oat patch in the rain, and wouldn’t it be a good thing if you had something to put Baby Oo Oo in so that you could pick the oats with both hands? A leaf a gourd shell a net a bag a sling a sack a bottle a pot a box a container. A holder. A recipient.\n\n\u003e The first cultural device was probably a recipient.... Many theorizers feel that the earliest cultural inventions must have been a container to hold gathered products and some kind of sling or net carrier.\n\nSo says Elizabeth Fisher in _Women’s Creation_ (McGraw-Hill, 1975). But no, this cannot be. Where is that wonderful, big, long, hard thing, a bone, I believe, that the Ape Man first bashed somebody in the movie and then, grunting with ecstasy at having achieved the first proper murder, flung up into the sky, and whirling there it became a space ship thrusting its way into the cosmos to fertilize it and produce at the end of the movie a lovely fetus, a boy of course, drifting around the Milky Way without (oddly enough) any womb, any matrix at all? I don’t know. I don’t even care. I’m not telling that story. We’ve heard it, we’ve all heard about all the sticks and spears and swords, the things to bash and poke and hit with, the long, hard things, but we have not heard about the thing to put things in, the container for the thing contained. That is a new story. That is news.\n\nAnd yet old. Before — once you think about it, surely long before — the weapon, a late, luxurious, superfluous tool; long before the useful knife and ax; right along with the indispensable whacker, grinder, and digger — for what’s the use of digging up a lot of potatoes if you have nothing to lug the ones you can’t eat home in — with or before the tool that forces energy outward, we made the tool that brings energy home. It makes sense to me. I am an adherent of what Fisher calls the Carrier Bag Theory of human evolution.\n\nThis theory not only explains large areas of theoretical obscurity and avoids large areas of theoretical nonsense (inhabited largely by tigers, foxes, and other highly territorial mammals); it also grounds me, personally, in human culture in a way I never felt grounded before. So long as culture was explained as originating from and elaborating upon the use of long, hard objects for sticking, bashing, and killing, I never thought that I had, or wanted, any particular share in it. (“What Freud mistook for her lack of civilization is woman’s lack of _loyalty_ to civilization,” Lillian Smith observed.) The society, the civilization they were talking about, these theoreticians, was evidently theirs; they owned it, they liked it; they were human, fully human, bashing, sticking, thrusting, killing. Wanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but if that’s what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then evidently I was either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all.\n\nThat’s right, they said. What you are is a woman. Possibly not human at all, certainly defective. Now be quiet while we go on telling the Story of the Ascent of Man the Hero.\n\nGo on, say I, wandering off towards the wild oats, with Oo Oo in the sling and little Oom carrying the basket. You just go on telling how the mammoth fell on Boob and how Cain fell on Abel and how the bomb fell on Nagasaki and how the burning jelly fell on the villagers and how the missiles will fall on the Evil Empire, and all the other steps in the Ascent of Man.\n\nIf it is a human thing to do to put something you want, because it’s useful, edible, or beautiful, into a bag, or a basket, or a bit of rolled bark or leaf, or a net woven of your own hair, or what have you, and then take it home with you, home being another, larger kind of pouch or bag, a container for people, and then later on you take it out and eat it or share it or store it up for winter in a solider container or put it in the medicine bundle or the shrine or the museum, the holy place, the area that contains what is sacred, and then next day you probably do much the same again — if to do that is human, if that’s what it takes, then I am a human being after all. Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time.\n\nNot, let it be said at once, an unaggressive or uncombative human being. I am an aging, angry woman laying mightily about me with my handbag, fighting hoodlums off. However I don’t, nor does anybody else, consider myself heroic for doing so. It’s just one of those damned things you have to do in order to be able to go on gathering wild oats and telling stories.\n\nIt is the story that makes the difference. It is the story that hid my humanity from me, the story the mammoth hunters told about bashing, thrusting, raping, killing, about the Hero. The wonderful, poisonous story of Botulism. The killer story.\n\nIt sometimes seems that the story is approaching its end. Lest there be no more telling of stories at all, some of us out here in the wild oats, amid the alien corn, think we’d better start telling another one, which maybe people can go on with when the old one’s finished. Maybe. The trouble is, we’ve all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. Hence it is with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the untold one, the life story.\n\nIt’s unfamiliar, it doesn’t come easily, thoughtlessly, to the lips as the killer story does; but still, “untold” was an exaggeration. People have been telling the life story for ages, in all sorts of words and ways. Myths of creation and transformation, trickster stories, folktales, jokes, novels....\n\nThe novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story. Of course the Hero has frequently taken it over, that being his imperial nature and uncontrollable impulse, to take everything over and run it while making stern decrees and laws to control his uncontrollable impulse to kill it. So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the arrow or spear, starting _here_ and going straight _there_ and THOK! hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the story isn’t any good if he isn’t in it.\n\nI differ with all of this. I would go so far as to say that the natural, proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us.\n\nOne relationship among elements in the novel may well be that of conflict, but the reduction of narrative to conflict is absurd. (I have read a how-to-write manual that said, “A story should be seen as a battle,” and went on about strategies, attacks, victory, etc.) Conflict, competition, stress, struggle, etc., within the narrative conceived as carrier bag/belly/box/house/medicine bundle, may be seen as necessary elements of a whole which itself cannot be characterized either as conflict or as harmony, since its purpose is neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process.\n\nFinally, it’s clear that the Hero does not look well in this bag. He needs a stage or a pedestal or a pinnacle. You put him in a bag and he looks like a rabbit, like a potato.\n\nThat is why I like novels: instead of heroes they have people in them.\n\nSo, when I came to write science-fiction novels, I came lugging this great heavy sack of stuff, my carrier bag full of wimps and klutzes, and tiny grains of things smaller than a mustard seed, and intricately woven nets which when laboriously unknotted are seen to contain one blue pebble, an imperturbably functioning chronometer telling the time on another world, and a mouse’s skull; full of beginnings without ends, of initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and far more tricks than conflicts, far fewer triumphs than snares and delusions; full of space ships that get stuck, missions that fail, and people who don’t understand. I said it was hard to make a gripping tale of how we wrested the wild oats from their husks, I didn’t say it was impossible. Who ever said writing a novel was easy?\n\nIf science fiction is the mythology of modern technology, then its myth is tragic. “Technology,” or “modern science” (using the words as they are usually used, in an unexamined shorthand standing for the “hard” sciences and high technology founded upon continuous economic growth), is a heroic undertaking, Herculean, Promethean, conceived as triumph, hence ultimately as tragedy. The fiction embodying this myth will be, and has been, triumphant (Man conquers earth, space, aliens, death, the future, etc.) and tragic (apocalypse, holocaust, then or now).\n\nIf, however, one avoids the linear, progressive, Time’s-(killing)-arrow mode of the Techno-Heroic, and redefines technology and science as primarily cultural carrier bag rather than weapon of domination, one pleasant side effect is that science fiction can be seen as a far less rigid, narrow field, not necessarily Promethean or apocalyptic at all, and in fact less a mythological genre than a realistic one.\n\nIt is a strange realism, but it is a strange reality.\n\nScience fiction properly conceived, like all serious fiction, however funny, is a way of trying to describe what is in fact going on, what people actually do and feel, how people relate to everything else in this vast stack, this belly of the universe, this womb of things to be and tomb of things that were, this unending story. In it, as in all fiction, there is room enough to keep even Man where he belongs, in his place in the scheme of things; there is time enough to gather plenty of wild oats and sow them too, and sing to little Oom, and listen to Ool’s joke, and watch newts, and still the story isn’t over. Still there are seeds to be gathered, and room in the bag of stars.\n\n\n---\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Cognitive-Dissonance":{"title":"Cognitive Dissonance","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Columnist":{"title":"Columnist","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Confirmation-Bias":{"title":"Confirmation Bias","content":"\n[[Everything You Know Is Wrong]]\n[[We believe what we want to believe]]","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Consumerism":{"title":"Consumerism","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Core-Tenets":{"title":"Core Tenets - Mental Health","content":"\n1.

But mostly people who aren't in distress currently\n\u003eand people who dissociate/zone out a lot, and over-workers. \n \nYou know when you've worked your ass off and you achieve something? Before you can even appreciate yourself for it, you're onto the next task, the next goal, the next destination. \n\nWe've all heard \"It's the journey, not the destination\". It's one of those aphorisms I scoff at. _But it is true._\nDestination mindset can be because of the kind of world we live in, hyper-competitive, #hustle and sigma grindset world. It can also be the result of a childhood where you had to constantly prove your worth, a childhood where perfectionism was not just a mere coping mechanism, but a survival mechanism. High expectations, parents you can never please, all that jazz. You didn't and don't deserve that though. You deserve to take a break. Taking a break does not make you lazy. [[Laziness|You Are Not Lazy]]. \n\nI digress, but let's come back to the topic on hand. ***Destination Mindset***. Talking and writing about this makes me feel like one of those lifestyle bloggers, ones who write about zen or whatever word is fancy. \"Mindfulness\" sounds like one of those terms too, and it quite honestly is. It's one of the hottest words right now. \n\n  \u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/3045_RC01/embed_loader.js\"\u003e\n  \u003c/script\u003e\n  \n  \u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\"\u003e\n    trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(\"TIMESERIES\", {\"comparisonItem\":[{\"keyword\":\"mindfulness\",\"geo\":\"\",\"time\":\"2004-01-01 2022-07-30\"}],\"category\":0,\"property\":\"\"}, {\"exploreQuery\":\"date=all\u0026q=mindfulness\",\"guestPath\":\"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/\"});\n  \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003csmall\u003e Interest over time for 'mindfulness' (Google Trends, 2004 - July 2022) \u003c/small\u003e\n\nWant to sell something? Slap on \"mindfulness\" for extra points. \n\nBut no, when I talk to mindfulness, I'm usually referring to the Marsha Linehan's version, which is heavily borrowed from Buddhism among other things. In short, it is a core component of DBT and it means to bring your mind back to the present moment. And not judge your thoughts. \n\nSounds simple, right? Like, pfft, EVERYONE knows that! Everyone does, they do understand the concept but to foster the habit, to cultivate mindfulness? That's hard. I have ADHD, I dissociate A LOT, and a whole lot of other fun stuff. Meditation makes me feel worse for some reason. It wasn't easy for me to get started on this journey of mindfulness, and I've barely even started the journey. But I do promise that mindfulness helps. One of the reasons it took me so long was the internal resistance. I thought the concept was stupid, that it's just one of those things that people say. \"Oh, have you tried yoga?\" or \"Oh, you should get out more I think\". \n\nDestination Mindset is the constant focus on getting somewhere and forgetting to appreciate where we are. It's completely natural. The system \"awards\" constant effort, no breaks, etc. It reinforces it every single time. But no, the journey is as important as the destination. Probably more. Take a moment to celebrate yourself. (Ugh I feel like one of those fake, shallow lifestyle bloggers again, gross.)\n\n\nThis ties in with another important part of DBT, gratitude. Gratitude is hard when you're in a shitty place. It's almost impossible. But when you are in a relatively okay place, you should definitely start practicing gratitude. You don't even have to maintain a fancy gratitude journal. Just try to enjoy the coffee you're sipping. When was the last time you took the time out and enjoyed a meal? Half the times, I don't know what I'm eating. It's like things happen, but they don't register in my head. \n\nFuck what it ought to be, what it can be, what it should have been; fuck the destination. Wherever you go, there you are. And you have the right to stop and sniff the flowers. Will you enjoy it? Maybe. Maybe not. But don't deprive yourself of the opportunity and most importantly, DON'T BE HARSH ON YOURSELF IF YOU CAN'T ENJOY SIMPLE THINGS BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU'RE IN. It's natural. Asking someone to be thankful for their coffee when the world is on fire sounds stupid, and it is stupid. But be kind to yourself, and try to be more present, more in the moment.","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Digital-Gardens":{"title":"Digital Gardens","content":"\n\nMeowwww test test\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Dissociation":{"title":"Dissociation","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Distortions":{"title":"Cognitive Distortions","content":"\n\nThere are more distortions than I can possibly cover in one post, but I did my best to highlight the most common ones.

If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.\nOver Generalization: You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.\n\nMental Filter: You pick out a single negative detail and dwePell on it exclusively so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that discolors the entire beaker of water.\n\nDisqualifying the Positive: You reject positive experiences by insisting they \"don't count\" for some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your everyday experiences.\n\nJumping to Conclusion: You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support you conclusions.\nMind Reading: You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you, and you don't bother to check this out.\n\nThe Fortune Teller Error: You anticipate that things will turn out badly, and you feel convinced that your prediction is an established fact.\nMagnification (catastrophizing) or Minimization: You exaggerate the importance of things, or you inappropriately shrink things until the appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or the other fellow's imperfections).\n\nEmotional Reasoning: You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: \"I feel it, therefore it must be true\".\n\nShould Statements: You try to motivate yourself with should and shouldn't, as if you\nhad to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything. \n\"Musts\" and \"oughts\" are also offenders. The emotional consequences is guilt. When you direct should statements toward others you feel anger, frustration, and resentment.\n\nLabeling and Mislabeling: This is an extreme form of over generalization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: \"I’m a loser\". When someone else's behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to them.\n\nPersonalization: You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event which in fact you were not primarily responsible for.","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Everything-You-Know-Is-Wrong":{"title":"Everything You Know Is Wrong","content":"\n\nThings that'll shake your beliefs\nvvv existential \nwill make you rethink a lot of things\n\n#blog\n\nexamples/content - \na.

LOC basically is how you view control over your own life. People either have an internal LOC where they believe they have the power to control thier own lives, or an external LOC where you believe everything in life comes from a source other than yourself (I got fired because my boss hates me, I was late because traffic...etc.). Now, what's interesting is that studies have shown people with an internal LOC find greater satisfaction and success in almost every aspect of life.....except one......being in a nursing home. Drives internal LOC people CRAZY while external LOC people thrive\n\n**When something goes wrong, it’s natural to cast blame on the perceived cause of the misfortune. Where an individual casts that blame can be related, in many cases, to a psychological construct known as “locus of control.”**\n\nJulian B. Rotter developed the locus of control concept in 1954, and it continues to play an important role in personality studies. In 1966, Rotter created a 13-item forced-choice scale in order to measure locus of control\n\n\nMost people have either an internal or external [locus of control.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ulterior-motives/201402/control-and-health) Those with an internal locus of control believe that their actions matter, and they are the authors of their own destiny.

YOU ARE NOT LAZY. \n\nDifferent tasks need different amount of energy, right? And different people need different amounts of energy for the same task. Sounds like such a fundamentally simple concept but people don't seem to recognize this. \n\nAnd for a lot of us, the amount of mental work we constantly do is enough to tire us out. This can look like laziness to others, but it is not. \n\n### What about stuff like \"[[Secondary Gain]]\"?\nTo those who aren't familiar with the term, it basically means that people who are in a bad place, disabled, injured, or whatever, they might have less incentive to get better because of the sympathy, attention, and other ✨amazing benefits✨they get. This might be true, but it is not always the case. In my experience, it's often not the case at all! Just go online and look at the number of people who are invalidating themselves (not their fault) and thinking they're faking their illness. Impostor syndrome in mental illness and sufferring too. \"Maybe I'm just being extra?\" \"Maybe I did all of this for attention?\" \n\nAnd even if it is true, what use is it if it causes more harm than good? People who are already traumatized go harder on themselves because of ableist bullshit like this. \n\nAre you saying that I enjoy the \"attention\" I get by not doing my work? You're right. As much as I enjoy having anxiety attacks, crying, and panicking over the same unfinished work. It's easier to do the work than go through this hell. It is easier to go through shit and get it done than faking an illness, having breakdowns, and being hyper-aware of the consequences of my actions. Why don't I just do it then? Definitely not because there's a road block in my head. It's because I'm lazy AND I enjoy this, duh!\n\nRead also [[Spoon Theory]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Libre":{"title":"Libre","content":"\nsee also: [[Open Source]]","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Linehan":{"title":"Marsha Linehan","content":"\n\nMarsha Linehan - Author of DBT \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Marketing":{"title":"Marketing","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/McFeely":{"title":"McFeely","content":"\nIt's nearly 5 AM, so I will aim for neither eloquence or style. I don't quite remember when I found out about Mr Rogers, quite possibly two years ago, or maybe more. Time seems to be a weird concept, doubly when you're in the middle of what seems to be a ceaseless pandemic.\n\nI was up, reading statistics and news about the virus (would definitely not recommend that. Wasn't my first time, won't be my last). Nothing soothes my anxiety like some freshly baked numbers and research articles that affirm your worst fears. **I hate that I do this despite knowing well about my anxiety, but that's the nature of anxiety; pervasive and enduring, playing both the firestarter and the forest fire that burns down the woods of my sanity. I need to seek information to make sure I'm prepared, but that very information causes more anxiety**\n\nI digress, but trying to get back to the topic of today's ramblings - Mr Rogers. I get distressed A LOT. Sometimes, very few times,(times when I'm not numb because of the bottling up, or the times when I'm not rolled into a tear-spewing ball) I look at work by Mr Rogers. And boy does it help!\n\nFor those of you who aren't familiar with him - He's probably the nicest well-known person to ever exist. He quells the fiery rage in me, soothes the child in me, and reminds me of the importance of kindness. Cheesy, I know.\n\nMr Rogers was a TV show host. A kids' TV show host at that. \n\n\"Pfft, why aren't you over a kids' TV show host, you're 21!\" \n\nWell... because he wasn't just any TV show host, he was this Presbyterian minister who didn't like what was displayed on kids television shows, so he went out to change that.\n\n\"Umm. Isn't shitting on religious conservatives who are offended by innocuous things YOUR THING? Basically, your favourite hobby?\"\na) That isn't my favourite hobby, that's my second favourite one. \nb) Shame on you for jumping to conclusions and thinking that Christian minister = conservative, and for discarding his ideas just because of his beliefs.\n\n\"But, I'm just reading what you wrote! I'm one of your voice-\"\n\nAnyway, with all the distractions now gone, let's get back. **Fred Rogers**. A man who wanted to do something to change how kids' programmes were violent, mindless, and provided no value. My initial knee-jerk reaction to this was \"OMG, don't kill the fun!\", but then I saw the things he accomplished. Most notably, Mr Rogers' Neighborhood. Imagine the coziest, fluffiest, warmest thing you can. That's Mr Rogers' Neighbourhood.\n\nI can't do it justice, so I'll simply direct you to https://www.misterrogers.org/our-television-neighbor/.\n\nAnd for the lazy ones, here's an excerpt that does more justice than I did, but still not enough justice - _Over more than 30 years Mister Rogers created a relationship with millions of children, each of whom felt like they were visiting with a trusted friend. Mister Rogers looked directly into the camera and sang and talked to each child watching. His radical kindness, acceptance, and empathy created a place that as TV Guide described: “ **makes us, young and old alike, feel safe, cared for and valued… Wherever Mister Rogers is, so is sanctuary.**”\n\nWow, so I can't believe I just spent the entire time JUST trying to introduce Mister Rogers and still butchering it.\n\nBut anyway, I _adore_ Mr Rogers. I've never been the kind of person to have a role model. (Don't put people on a pedestal, right?) I never really found anyone who was amazing enough to be role model material, you know? But Mr Rogers? Him I can confidently call my role model.\n\nWhy did his work resonate so much with me? Because... Our beliefs were aligned! When I was around 15, I was struck by what I called an epiphany but now call common sense. I came to the (not so) startling conclusion that most \"bad behaviour\", as I termed it then, could be traced back to a bad childhood. I postulated that most crimes happen because of fucked up childhoods. Of course, it is more nuanced than that, but it really does hold true to a certain extent. Childhood shapes us. It's the most important part of our lives, but I feel like we don't give it enough importance. Kids will be kids. No! They'll grow up to be ill-functioning caffeine-addicted adults someday!\n\nMr Rogers understood this. He understood the importance of love and empathy. Of kindness. Of self-acceptance. On his show, he made sure that everyone felt like they had a friend. He extended love.\n\nBut that's not it. It wasn't just the fact that I shared his view, or the general altruistic feel-goodness that made me connect with Mister Rogers. It was something more personal. He told me things I've always wanted to hear. It might sound weird to picture a grown-ass adult crying at Mr Rogers singing \"It's you I like\", but I found out I wasn't the only one. I introduced it to my then-partner and they did the same. Both of us had a fragmented childhood and it just hit us right in the feels. Do yourself a favour and listen to it. https://misterrogers.org/videos/its-you-i-like/\n\nLook at the lyrics and tell me you didn't feel a thing -\n\nIt's you I like, It's not the things you wear, It's not the way you do your hair-- But it's you I like. The way you are right now, The way down deep inside you-- Not the things that hide you, Not your toys-- They're just beside you.\n\nBut it's you I like-- Every part of you, Your skin, your eyes, your feelings Whether old or new. I hope that you'll remember Even when you're feeling blue That it's you I like, It's you yourself, It's you, it's you I like.\n\n(It's okay if the lyrics didn't do anything to you, Mister Rogers loves you regardless)\n\nMr Rogers was the father I never had. The friend I never had. But the one all of us need, especially in these bleak times. His show wasn't just some silly show, the little details that make up the show are just so beautiful; I urge you to explore.\n\nHe covered serious issues. From divorce to death and everything in between, Mister Rogers talked about, gently. In a way that a child can understand. He helped them process their feelings. “Whatever is mentionable can be more manageable.” Mr Rogers normalised so many things and made help more accessible.\n\n\"He understood that new experiences or changes in routine can feel overwhelming and scary to young children. He showed us what to expect. He reassured us. He prepared us to meet and trust the people who would care for us – the doctor, the dentist, the barber, the teacher.\" He'd cover things most people would deem mundane, things most networks would take a hard pass on.\n\nHe treated children with respect and saw them as equals; he didn't patronise them. He actually listened.\n\nThe best part? The lessons he taught aren't exclusively for children. A lot of us could use them too. They're cathartic, trust me.\n\nI have a large collection of Mister Rogers quotes, but I'll leave you with these.\n\n\u003e “Everyone longs to be loved. And the greatest thing we can do is to let people know that they are loved and capable of loving.”\n\n\u003e \"Imagine what our real neighborhoods would be like if each of us offered, as a matter of course, just one kind word to another person.\"\n\n**I never thought I'd quote Tommy Wiseau in a post about Fred Rogers, but - \"If a lot of people love each other, the world would be a better place to live.\"** True Tommy, I'm with you on that. If only everyone were more true to their feelings. But maybe we'll get there!\nI'll wind up this needlessly lengthy post that didn't manage to capture an ounce of the legacy that Mr Rogers has left with a quote that I really love and find comforting.\n\n\u003e _“**When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, “Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.”**_\n\nLook for the helpers. Not to be dramatic, but this phrase sorta reignited my faith in humanity, kinda helped me view everything a bit differently, you know?\n\nThank you, Fred McFeely Rogers. Thank you for reminding me of the oath I took as a kid. To spread love, respect, and happiness no matter what. I have faltered, I have gone astray, but I am giving it my best.","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Money-is-the-root":{"title":"Money is the root","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Mood-Thought-Diary":{"title":"Mood Thought Diary","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/ObjectConstancy":{"title":"Object Constancy","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Occams-Razor":{"title":"Occam's Razor","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Ontological-Parasite":{"title":"Ontological Parasite","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Open-Source":{"title":"Open Source","content":"\nsee also : [[Libre]]","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Perceived-threat":{"title":"Perceived threat","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Philosophies":{"title":"Philosophies and Concepts That Have Changed My Life","content":"\n\n- [[Libre]] - *Free as in Freedom* \n- [[Digital Gardens]]\n- [[mindfulness]] \n- [[feminism]] and [[intersectionalism]]\n- \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Poes-Law":{"title":"Poe's Law","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Prenatal":{"title":"Prenatal","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Quotes":{"title":"Quotes","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Rehabilitation":{"title":"Rehabilitation over Punishment","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Research-Methodologies":{"title":"Research Methodologies","content":"\n==using known information to find unknown\nnew information==\n\n- is scientific\n- any branch of knowledge\n- rational\n- based on facts, rooted in reality \n\n\n\n\n- \"systemized way to gain new information\" - \n- \"movement from known to unknown\"\n- problem to conclusion\n\n## Definition\n*Comprises of defining, redefining*\n*manipulation of situation, control the env/variables*\n\n## Variables and \n\n## Objective of Research / Motivation\n1.

It was developed by Christine Miserandino in 2003 as a way to express how it felt to have lupus. She used spoons to provide a visual representation of units of energy that a person might have and how chronic illness forces her to plan out her days and actions in advance, so as not to run out of energy, or spoons, before the end of the day. It has since been applied to other phenomena, such as other disabilities, mental health issues, marginalization, and other factors that might place an extra – often unseen – burden on some individuals.\"  - [Wikipedia page for Spoon Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Storm-Tim-Minchin":{"title":"Storm - Tim Minchin","content":"## Storm by Tim Minchin\n\n**Lyrics:**\n\nThis is a nine-minute beat poem.  \nIt's called, \"Storm\"\n\nInner North London, top floor flat,  \nAll white walls, white carpet, white cat,  \nRice paper partitions, modern art and ambition  \nThe host's a physician,  \nBright bloke, has his own practice  \nHis girlfriend's an actress, an old mate of ours from home  \nAnd they're always great fun, so to dinner we've come.\n\nThe 5th guest is an unknown,  \nThe hosts have just thrown us together for a favour  \n'Cause this girl's just arrived from Australia  \nAnd she's moved to North London  \nAnd she's the sister of someone or has some connection.\n\nAs we make introductions I'm struck by her beauty  \nShe's irrefutably fair with dark eyes and dark hair  \nBut as she sits, I admit I'm a little bit wary  \n'Cause I notice the tip of the wing of a fairy  \nTattooed on that popular area just above the derrière  \nAnd when she says \"I'm Sagittarian, \"  \nI confess a pigeonhole starts to form  \nAnd is immediately filled with pigeon when she says her name is Storm.\n\nConversation is initially bright and light hearted  \nBut it's not long before Storm gets started:  \n\"You can't know anything, knowledge is merely opinion!\"  \nShe opines, over her Cabernet Sauvignon,  \nVis-à-vis some unhippily empirical comment by me.\n\n\"Not a good start\" I think,  \nWe're only on pre-dinner drinks,  \nAnd across the room, my wife widens her eyes,  \nSilently begs me: \"Be nice!\"  \nA matrimonial warning, not worth ignoring  \nSo I resist the urge to ask Storm  \nWhether knowledge is so loose-weave of a morning when  \nDeciding whether to leave her apartment by the front door  \nOr the window on her second floor.\n\nThe food is delicious and Storm,  \nWhilst avoiding all meat happily sits and eats  \nAs the good doctor,  \nSlightly pissedly holds court on some  \nAnachronistic aspect of medical history  \nWhen Storm suddenly insists:  \n\"But the human body is a mystery!\"  \n\"Science just falls in a hole when it  \nTries to explain the the nature of the soul.\"\n\nMy hostess throws me a glance.  \nShe, like my wife, knows there's a chance  \nI'll be off on one of my rare but fun rants but I shan't  \nMy lips are sealed, I just wanna enjoy the meal  \nAnd although Storm is starting to get my goat  \nI have no intention of rocking the boat  \nAlthough it's becoming a bit of a wrestle  \nBecause like her meteorological namesake,  \nStorm has no such concerns for our vessel:\n\n\"Pharmaceutical companies are the enemy,  \nThey promote drug dependency at the cost of the natural remedies  \nThat are all our bodies need  \nThey are immoral and driven by greed.  \nWhy take drugs when herbs can solve it?  \nWhy use chemicals when homeopathic solvents can resolve it?  \nI think it's time we all  \nReturn-to-live with natural medical alternatives.\"\n\nAnd try as I like, a small crack appears in my diplomacy-dike.  \n\"By definition, \" I begin,  \n\"Alternative medicine, \" I continue,  \n\"Has either not been proved to work, or been proved not to work.  \nDo you know what they call  \nAlternative medicine that's been proved to work?  \nMedicine.\"\n\n\"So you don't believe in any natural remedies?\"\n\n\"On the contrary Storm, actually  \nBefore we came to tea,  \nI took a natural remedy derived from the bark of a willow tree  \nA painkiller that's virtually side-effect free  \nIt's got a weird name, darling, what was it again?  \nM-masprin? Basprin? Oh yeah! Asprin!  \nWhich I paid about a buck for down at the local drugstore.\n\nThe debate briefly abates as my hosts collect plates  \nBut as they return with desserts Storm pertly asserts:  \n\"Shakespeare said it first:  \nThere are more things in heaven and  \nEarth than exist in your philosophy.  \nScience is just how we're trained to look at reality,  \nIt doesn't explain love or spirituality.  \nHow does science explain psychics? Auras?  \nThe afterlife? The power of prayer?\"\n\nI'm becoming aware that I'm staring, I'm like a rabbit  \nSuddenly trapped in the blinding headlights of vacuous crap.  \nMaybe it's the Hamlet she just misquothed  \nOr the sixth glass of wine I just quaffed  \nBut my diplomacy dike groans  \nAnd the arsehole held back by its stones can be held back no more:\n\n\"Look, Storm,  \nSorry I don't mean to bore you but there's no such thing as an aura!  \nReading Auras is like reading minds or  \nTea-leaves or star-signs or meridian lines  \nThese people aren't applying a skill,  \nThey're either lying or mentally ill.  \nSame goes for people who claim they hear God's demands  \nAnd spiritual healers who think they've magic hands.\n\nBy the way, why do we think it's okay for  \nPeople to pretend they can talk to the dead?  \nIsn't that totally fucked in the head?  \nLying to some crying woman whose child has died  \nAnd telling her you're in touch with the other side?  \nI think that's fundamentally sick  \nDo we need to clarify here that there's no such thing as a psychic?\n\nWhat are we, fucking two?  \nDo we actually think that Horton Heard a Who?  \nDo we still believe that Santa brings us gifts?  \nThat Michael Jackson didn't have facelifts?  \nAre we still so stunned by circus tricks that we think  \nThat the dead would wanna talk to pricks like John Edwards?\n\nStorm to her credit despite my derision keeps firing off clichés  \nWith startling precision like a sniper using bollocks for ammunition\n\n\"You're so sure of your position but you're just closed-minded  \nI think you'll find that your faith in science and  \nTests is just as blind as the faith of any fundamentalist\"\n\n\"Wow that's a good point, let me think for a bit.  \nOh wait, my mistake, that's absolute bullshit.  \nScience adjusts it's views based on what's observed.  \nFaith is the denial of observation so that Belief can be preserved.  \nIf you show me that, say, homeopathy works, then I will change my mind  \nI'll spin on a fucking dime  \nI'll be embarrassed as hell,  \nBut I will run through the streets yelling  \n'It's a miracle! Take physics and bin it!  \nWater has memory!  \nAnd while it's memory of a long  \nLost drop of onion juice seems Infinite  \nIt somehow forgets all the poo it's had in it!'\n\nYou show me that it works and how it works  \nAnd when I've recovered from the shock  \nI will take a compass and carve 'Fancy That' on the side of my cock.\"\n\nEveryone's just staring now,  \nBut I'm pretty pissed and I've dug this far down,  \nSo I figure, in for penny, in for a pound:\n\n\"Life is full of mysteries, yeah  \nBut there are answers out there  \nAnd they won't be found by people sitting around  \nLooking serious and saying 'Isn't life mysterious?'  \n'Let's sit here and hope.  \nLet's call up the fucking Pope.  \nLet's go watch Oprah interview Deepak Chopra.'\n\nIf you wanna watch tele, you should watch Scooby Doo.  \nThat show was so cool because every time there  \nWas a church with a ghoul or a ghost in a school  \nThey looked beneath the mask and what was inside?  \nThe fucking janitor or the dude who ran the waterslide.  \nBecause throughout history every  \nMystery ever solved has turned out to be  \nNot Magic.\n\nDoes the idea that there might be knowledge frighten you?  \nDoes the idea that one afternoon on  \nWiki-fucking-pedia might enlighten you frighten you?  \nDoes the notion that there may not be a supernatural so blow your  \nHippy noodle that you'd rather just  \nStand in the fog of your inability to Google?\n\nIsn't this enough?\n\nJust this world?\n\nJust this beautiful, complex, wonderfully unfathomable, natural world?  \nHow does it so fail to hold our attention that we have to  \nDiminish it with the invention of cheap, man-made myths and monsters?  \nIf you're so into your Shakespeare, lend me your ear:  \n\"To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,  \nTo throw perfume on the violet... is just fucking silly\"  \nOr something like that.  \nOr what about Satchmo?!  \n\"I see trees of Green,  \nRed roses too, \"  \nAnd fine, if you wish to glorify Krishna and Vishnu in a  \nPost-colonial,  \nCondescending bottled-up and labeled  \nKind of way then whatever, that's ok.  \nBut here's what gives me a hard-on:  \nI am a tiny, insignificant, ignorant bit of carbon.  \nI have one life, and it is short and unimportant...  \nBut thanks to recent scientific advances I get to live  \nTwice as long as my great great great great uncleses and auntses.  \nTwice as long to live this life of mine  \nTwice as long to love this wife of mine  \nTwice as many years of friends and wine  \nOf sharing curries and getting shitty at good-looking hippies  \nWith fairies on their spines and butterflies on their titties.\n\nAnd if perchance I have offended  \nThink but this and all is mended:  \nWe'd as well be 10 minutes back in time,  \nFor all the chance you'll change your mind\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nMy thoughts -\n \n_Storm_ is Tim Minchin through and through. It’s a lesson in skepticism and rationality while being an entertaining and quotable laughfest that not only mocks alternative medicine but also poses real, valid questions. Storm is as educational as it is riveting. It captures the spirit of science. \n\nI did however find the few [[ad hominem|insults that attacked the person]] to be in bad taste. \n\n\n  \n\n_\"By definition, \" I begin,_\n_\"Alternative medicine, \" I continue,_\n_\"Has either not been proved to work, or been proved not to work._\n\n_Do you know what they call_\n_Alternative medicine that's been proved to work?_\n_**Medicine**__.\"_  \n\nNot a single minute is wasted in this 10-minute short, not a second goes by where we are not witnesses to Tim’s unparalleled wordplay, timing, and melody. _Storm_ perfectly encapsulates Tim Minchin and his work. In his words, he wrote _Storm_ in an attempt to “find more attractive ways to teach young people how to think critically”.

Over time, this practice—even if you only engage in it occasionally—can help you change your relationship with food to one that is more present-centered, satisfying, and healthier.\" \n\n**Mini-Mindfulness Practices**\n\nAlthough multitasking may be unavoidable at times, the daily experience of pressure to “get things done” unconsciously ensnares many people in its gravitational pull. Multitasking frequently becomes standard operating procedure, even when it isn’t necessary.\n\n1.  Strive to minimize multitasking and do one thing at a time; be present with the task at hand, giving it your undiluted [attention](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention \"Psychology Today looks at attention\").\n2.  Do it deliberately and without rushing—even (and perhaps especially) if you feel pressure—external or internal—to do so. As John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach, regularly instructed his players, “Be quick, but don’t hurry.”\n3.  Do it to completion.\n4.  space—even a brief pause—between the activities in which you engage rather than going directly from one task to the next.\n5.  yourself permission to do less than what you may have planned or what your thinking says you “should do” or “have to do.”\n6.  Each time you scroll through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or other social media platforms, pause on a random name (be it someone you know or not) and take a moment to wish that person well—perhaps literally saying to yourself: __________, may you be well. May you be at peace.\n7.  As you wake up from sleep, take a moment while [lying](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/deception \"Psychology Today looks at lying\") in bed with your eyes open and express appreciation for the gift of waking up to another day. Not everyone receives this gift.\n8.  When you first step outside in the morning, take a few seconds to observe—without judgment—the sights and sounds of your neighborhood.\n9.  When you approach a window in your home or office, take a few moments to pause, look through it, and really notice what you see.\n\n**Mindful Eating**\n\nMany people, both in and out of recovery, eat emotionally—that is, they eat in response to stress or emotional discomfort ([anxiety](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety \"Psychology Today looks at anxiety\"), [fear](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear \"Psychology Today looks at fear\"), [loneliness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/loneliness \"Psychology Today looks at loneliness\"), [boredom](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/boredom \"Psychology Today looks at boredom\"), [anger](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger \"Psychology Today looks at anger\"), or sadness). Sometimes, this is also an attempt to fill a sense of internal emptiness. When people behave this way, they eat without thinking about what or why they’re eating; they may not even taste the food, which they chew quickly and incompletely. Have you ever finished eating something only to realize you don’t know how it tasted?\n\nMindful eating is the antithesis of [stressed](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress \"Psychology Today looks at stressed\") or [emotional eating](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/appetite \"Psychology Today looks at emotional eating\") and the antidote for it. Mindful eating means paying conscious attention to the experience of eating using all the senses. It emphasizes the awareness of taste, as well as colors, textures, smells, and sounds, during the process of eating. For instance, when mindfully eating an apple, you might notice the color, feel how smooth it is, take in its fragrance, listen to what it sounds like when you bite into it, and taste it fully, one bite at a time.\n\n1.  Before you eat, bring your awareness to the activity. Are you actually hungry and need nourishment in preparation for some activity, or are you eating out of some sort of emotional dis-ease?\n2.  As much as possible, try to eat before you get to the point of being extremely hungry.\n3.  Take two or three deep breaths to relax and connect your mind with your body.\n4.  Appreciate the food you’re getting ready to eat.\n5.  Consider what it took to get that food from its origins to your table.\n6.  As you eat, notice the aroma(s), texture(s), and color(s) of your food.\n7.  Take one bite at a time, tasting it fully.\n8.  Chew your food carefully, savoring it.\n9.  Swallow it slowly.\n10.  Wait until you’ve completely swallowed one bite of your food before taking the next one.\n11.  Pause briefly and take an intentional breath—in and out—between swallowing and taking that next bite.\n12.  As you eat, remind yourself to breathe.\n13.  Pay attention to when you feel satisfied or beginto feel “full.”\n14.  Stop eating when you reach this point, rather than continuing to eat until you feel “stuffed” and uncomfortable.\n15.  If there is food left, store it for another time.\n16.  Notice how you feel when you are finished eating.\n\nBy making the experience of taking food and drink into the body much more conscious, eating mindfully slows the process of ingesting, tasting, chewing, and swallowing. The intent is to pay close and careful attention to the sensory aspects of your food and the process of eating and to eat deliberately rather than unconsciously shoveling food into your face. The result is that you will eat more slowly, taste your food more thoroughly, chew your food more completely, and swallow it more patiently.\n\nAll of this contributes to healthier digestion. Over time, this practice—even if you only engage in it occasionally—can help you change your relationship with food to one that is more present-centered, satisfying, and healthier.\n\nCopyright 2019 Dan Mager, MSW \n[[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/some-assembly-required/201904/mindfulness-is-much-more-meditation]]\n\n---\n\nMindfulness is a state of active, open [attention](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/attention \"Psychology Today looks at attention\") to the present. This state is described as observing one’s thoughts and feelings without judging them as good or bad.\n\nThe emergence of mindfulness in Western culture can be attributed to Jon Kabat-Zinn. Kabat-Zinn studied mindfulness under several Buddhist teachers, such as Philip Kapleau and Thich Nhat Hanh. As a professor at the University of Massachusetts medical school in the late 1970s, Kabat-Zinn developed a program called Mindfulness-Based [Stress](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/stress \"Psychology Today looks at Stress\") Reduction (MBSR) to treat [chronic pain](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/chronic-pain \"Psychology Today looks at chronic pain\"). He discovered that patients would often try to avoid pain—but that that avoidance would lead to deeper distress. Practicing mindfulness was a more successful approach.\n\n### What is mindfulness?\n\nMindfulness encompasses two key ingredients: [awareness and acceptance.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/201502/what-is-mindfulness-and-how-does-it-work)\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/mindfulness\n\n\n---\nSpradlin (2003) adapts DBT’s “what” skills of mindfulness to help us begin the journey of practicing mindful awareness: \n### **Observe:**\n\n-   Start to simply _notice_ your environment, thoughts, feelings, and sensations without _reacting_ to them\n-   Observe the emotion you are feeling or the thought you are having\n-   Simply see it there before you, without adding anything to it, judging it, or trying to change it\n-   Avoid reacting to your emotions – say to yourself,”I notice that I feel love/anger/joy”\n-   Allow your thoughts, feelings, and sensations to come and go (as they all _do_) – control your _attention_, not _what_ you see\n-   Push nothing away (no matter how uncomfortable/painful) and cling to nothing (no matter how enjoyable/pleasant)\n-   Be _alert_ to all that enters your experience – every thought, feeling, and sensation\n-   Pay close attention to the input you receive from all 5 senses: sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste\n\n### **Describe:**\n\n-   Now that you have observed, use _words_ to practice describing your internal experience\n-   Stay descriptive and simple\n-   If you have been taught to ignore/belittle emotions, it can be difficult to be attentive and mindful to your experience\n-   If you have difficulty, or if this feels unnatural, simply say to yourself, “I notice that I’m feeling self-conscious right now”\n-   If you’re feeling frustrated or anxious, say to yourself, “I notice how my thoughts are coming very quickly right now”\n\n### **Participate:**\n\n-   With practice, mindfulness will allow you to more fully _participate_ in your own life and experiences\n-   Mindfulness will allow you to _fully engage_ in every experience without needing to “love” or “hate” it\n-   Practice simply participating in each moment as it comes – _be here now_\n-   If you need to make plans for the future, then _fully participate_ in making those plans\n-   Allow yourself to be a part of what is happening without obsessing over every detail or becoming self-conscious\n-   Practice _letting go_ of thoughts like “How am I doing?” or “How do I look?”\n\nhttps://www.mindfulnessmuse.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy/dbts-what-skills-of-mindfulness\n\n\n--- \n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/misterrogers":{"title":"misterrogers","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/tim-minchin":{"title":"tim minchin","content":"\n[[Storm - Tim Minchin]]","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null},"/templates-and-shiz":{"title":"Templates and shiz","content":"\n## CSS\n\n\n```css\ndiv.mermaid {\n    text-align: center;\n}\n```\n\n```css\n/*============bigger link popup preview  ================*/\n.popover.hover-popover {\n    position: absolute;\n    z-index: var(--layer-popover);\n    transform: scale(0.9); /* makes the content smaller */\n    max-height: 800px;    /* was 300 */\n    min-height: 100px;\n    width: 500px; /* was 400 */\n    overflow: hidden;      \n    padding: 0;\n    border-bottom: none;\n  }\n/* I'm not sure what this does, got popove code from Obsdn-Dark-Rmx */\n/*\n  .popover {\n    background-color: var(--background-primary);\n    border: 1px solid var(--background-primary-alt);\n    box-shadow: 3px 3px 7px var(--background-modifier-box-shadow);\n    border-radius: 6px;\n    padding: 15px 20px 10px 20px;\n    position: relative;\n}\n\n/* remove-tweak the bottom gradient on the popup: remove the gradient or set height to 0 */\n    .popover.hover-popover:after {\n      height: 0px;    \n      background: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent, var(--background-primary) 80%, var(--background-primary));\n  }\n\n/* Colour for pop-up text in ⌘+O */\n.suggestion-item.is-selected {\n  background-color: blue; /* PB changed from var(--text-accent) */\n  color: whitesmoke;\n}\n```\n\nResizable Mermaid diagrams\n```css\nsvg[id^=\"m\"][width][height][viewBox] {\n    max-width: 95%;\n    max-height: 95%;\n}\n\ndiv.mermaid {\n    margin-left: 0 !important;\n    text-align: center;\n    resize:both;\n    overflow:auto;\n    margin-bottom: 2px;\n    position:relative;\n    max-height: 600px;\n    max-width: 100%;\n}\n\ndiv.mermaid::after {\n    content:'';\n    display:block;\n    width:10px;\n    height:10px;\n    background-color:yellowgreen;\n    position:absolute;\n    right:0;\n    bottom:0;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Templates\n\n```\n---\ntitle: \"\"\ntags: ['']\ndate: \n---\n\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-04T14:58:44.497278844Z","tags":null}}
