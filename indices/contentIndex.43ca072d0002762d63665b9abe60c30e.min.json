Looking for my exam [[notes]]?)\n \nA hodge-podge of a digital garden[^digitalgarden], a codex vitae[^codex], a blog, and a wiki.  It's somewhat the sum of all my knowledge. Constantly evolving, changing, and morphing. ~~Also a place where I waste a lot of time, trying to make notes instead of studying or learning. jfdifsjd~~\n\nThis contains (or will contain) a lot of resources, my thoughts and opinion on a lot of things, some reflections, about philosophies, concepts that have really changed my life, and maybe even rants. \n\nYou'll find writings of all kinds here; Psychology, Epistemology, Politics, Tech, and everything under the sun.  (You will also find a lot of broken links and dead-ends or stub articles. It's a work in progress, perpetually.)\n \n(‚ö†Ô∏è Some things here might not apply to you, might be wrong, or straight up silly. I'd love to hear your opinions, though! And this is the Internet, so do use your due dilligence, and do your research. \n\nLeave a message in the chatbox [on my site](https://astroslair.xyz) or create an issue in the [Github Repository](https://github.com/corvusdeinanis/cuddly-train) I'm adding more ways to contact me, and also a discussion page on this site. Feel free to correct me, I love learning ^~^)\n\n### Why?\n\n- Everything is linked; to find links between seemingly unrelated things - even if the links are meaningless and are a result of correlation and nothing more\n- A **personal wiki** for me. You know how you want to pull up a particular study, or a particular statistic, or something else to win an argument but good ole tip-of-the-tongue syndrome hits? No? Just me? Okay. . . \n- To preserve knowledge and archive things interesting to me\n- To reflect and ponder, to welcome change instead of resist it. To revisit concepts and re-examine my views. \n- To make sure it's available to everyone \n- Zettelkasten Method (heavily inspired, loosely implemented)\n- To find how many times I refer to a topic, concept or even a phrase! \n- To reflect on and remember what I've learnt \n\n### Philosophy \nIt is a garden for ideas. For thoughts. For knowledge. You're free to visit. You can smell the flowers, you can sit down on the benches and relax. You can even find seeds you can propagate. ‚ô• \n\nThe aim of this little corner of the Internet is to make my personal wiki accessible, transparent (everything here is on the github repository, I'll be transparent about myy methods, etc), and free! [[Free as in freedom, not free beer.]]\n\n### My Setup \nThe site is built using [Quartz by Jack Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz). ü§ç\nI take notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), an amazing tool that truly is revolutionary.  \n\n\n\n[^codex]: A Codex vitae is a 'living document'.

How women have been historically excluded from things men easily have access to. \n\n## Characters\n### Mary Beton - \nNarrator\n### Mary Seton - \nMrs Beton's friend\n### Judith Shakespeare - \nFictional sister of Shakespeare\n### Mary Carmichael\n fictional writer whose book is found in the library\n\n\n---\n\nIntellectual freedom depends on material things\nPoetry depends upon intellectual freedom\nAnd woman always have been poor, not for 200 years but from the beginning of time. ***Women have not had a dog's chance of writing poetry. This is why I am laid so much focus on money and a room of one's own***. \n\n---\n\n\n## Summary \n\n### Chapter 1 - Oxbridge and interruptions\nThe narrator, a fictionalized version of Woolf, \nvisits **Oxbridge College**  \nNarrator had to present on \"Women and Fiction\"\nreflects on the different opportunities and privileges that men and women have in education and society, is walking on grass when she is interrupted by a Beadle who says she is not allowed there; reserved only for fellows and scholars\n***Fish metaphor*** - She says that ideas are like fishes, she drops her thoughts (fishing line) to catch a fish but is **interrupted**, losing her thought\n¬†\u003e just as the narrator seems to be on the verge of an insight, her thinking is cut off‚Äîusually by an authority figure trying to keep her in her place\n\nDejected, goes to library. Not let in unless accompanied by a male. \nAte at cafeteria, food was amazeballs unlike the one at Fernham. Compares both. \n\nsays ideas are not like how we think of them, the sudden glow of a bulb, but a result of \"rational intercourse\"‚Äì‚Äìintellectual exchange‚Äì‚Äìthat takes place in settings such as the college \n \n\n---\n\n### Chapter 2:  London, library\nThe narrator goes to London and visits the British Library. She finds many books written by men about women, but none by women themselves. \nNo books about their daily lives. \nShe wonders what women‚Äôs lives were like in history and invents the story of Judith Shakespeare, a talented sister of William Shakespeare who is oppressed by her family and society and commits suicide. She shows how women‚Äôs genius has been wasted and silenced\n\n---\n\n### Chapter 3: Examining past writers\nThe narrator examines the works of women writers in the nineteenth century, such as **Jane Austen**, **George Eliot**, and the **Bront√´ sisters**. She praises their achievements despite the difficulties they faced. She analyzes how their gender and social class influenced their style and perspective. She argues that women need to have a room of their own, both literally and figuratively, to write fiction \n\n### Chapter 4: Winchilsea, Cavendish, and Behn\nThe narrator continues to explore the legacy of women writers and their relation to tradition. \nShe says that women need to be financially independent but even that doesn't help fully. Says their anger bitters their work. Anger that they are not given the same privileges as men. Anger that they are excluded. \n\n**Lady Winchilsea** was a noblewoman but even her writing did not get respect because it was bitter \n**Margaret Cavendish**, too, failed because of the same reason. \n**Aphra Behn** - one of the first woman writers to have made money. Middle class. All women owe her for paving the way. \n\n**They don't have any access to a \"common sentence,\" that men have access to, the shared rhythm and form that unites male writers in a collective**\n\n---\n\n### Chapter 5: Chloe liked Olivia\nThe narrator reviews a novel by a contemporary woman writer named Mary Carmichael. She criticizes her for not having the rythm of Jane Austen.  Of the author trying hard not to be typecast as \"sentimental\". \n\nMary Carmichael writes **\"Chloe liked Olivia\"** which is monumental - it takes away heteronormativity - says out loud what was only whispered -  huge social leap \n\nShe argues that women need to express their sexuality and emotions to write fiction.\n\n---\n### Chapter 6:  Androgynous \nWoolf concludes her argument by exploring the idea of an androgynous mind that can transcend the limitations of gender and create great works of literature. \n\n**She is inspired by the sight of a man and a woman getting into a taxi together, which symbolizes the harmony and unity of the sexes.** \n\nShe cites Coleridge‚Äôs theory that a great mind is both masculine and feminine, and that such a balance is evident in Shakespeare‚Äôs genius. \n\nShe contrasts this ideal with the sex-consciousness of her own age, which she blames for the rise of fascism and the decline of literature. \n\nShe criticizes male writers who are obsessed with asserting their virility and female writers who are too bitter or resentful to express themselves freely. \n\nShe urges her audience to avoid thinking of their sex when they write, and to cultivate an incandescent and creative mind that can embrace both male and female aspects. She ends by asking them to earn money and a room of their own, and to write for the common good as well as for themselves\n\n---\n\n## Diving Deeper\n- Begins with a but, asks a question\n- psychological conditions encountered by women writers\n- Hypothesizes about women need:\n  i. Money\n  ii. Room of One's Own\n- analyzes diff bw male and female writers\n- writer highlights men's anger against women affects their artistic production \n\nThe narrator uses Charlotte Bronte to show how extraordinary it is  that Jane Austen was able to triumph over her situation by  accepting it. Bronte by contrast was aware of her misfortune and  never accepted it, and this bitterness came through in her fiction.  \nConsequently she was never able to achieve in the way Austen  achieved\n\n--- \n\n# Questions \n\n1) According to Virginia Woolf, a woman requires a room of her own to write fiction because she needs to have money and freedom from domestic and social obligations. She argues that women have been historically oppressed and deprived of education, property, and artistic expression by a patriarchal society that values men‚Äôs work over women‚Äôs. She says that women need to have a space where they can think, create, and express themselves without interruption or interference from men or other women.¬†She also says that women need to have a sense of their own history and tradition as writers, and to develop their own voice and style \n\n## Metaphors and Stuff\n(1) Fish metaphor \n(2) ","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.255165085Z","tags":null},"/Aaron-T-Beck":{"title":"Aaron T Beck","content":"\n![[images/Aaron T Beck.jpg|100]]\n\n**Aaron T Beck** (July 18, 1921¬†‚Äì November 1, 2021) - influential psychiatrist who is regarded as the **father of cognitive therapy** and **cognitive behavioural therapy**.\n\nDesigned many self report scales, including [[Beck's Depression Inventory]]. \n\n*The key to many psychological difficulties, Dr. Beck has found in 40 years of research and clinical work, lies not deep in the unconscious, but in ''thinking problems'' that are much closer to conscious awareness.*\n\nautomatic thoughts\n\n*Patients in cognitive therapy are encouraged to test their perceptions of themselves and others, as if they were scientists testing hypotheses.*\n\nHis work at the University of Pennsylvania inspired Martin Seligman to refine his own cognitive techniques and later work on **learned helplessness**\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart\nA---\u003eB---\u003eC---\u003eA\nA(The self)\nB(The world or environment)\nC(The future)\n```\n\nBeck's cognitive triad\n\n---\n\nwas inspired by Albert Ellis (founder of REBT)\ninspired Martin Seligman(who proposed and defined **learned helplessness**)\nworked with Maria Kovacs to make a depression scale for children\n\nwas inspired by stoicism","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.255165085Z","tags":null},"/Advice-to-Youth":{"title":"Advice to Youth - Mark Twain","content":"\nAdvice given to youth by [[Mark Twain]]\n\nselective obedience towards parents,\nrespecting superiors,\nthe wisdom of going to bed early and waking up early, \nlying, \nfirearm etiquette\nthe importance of good books\n\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]- Full Text\n\u003e Being told I would be expected to talk here, I inquired what sort of talk I ought to make. They said it should be something suitable to youth--something didactic, instructive, or something in the nature of good advice. Very well. I have a few things in my mind which I have often longed to say for the instruction of the young; for it is in one‚Äôs tender early years that such things will best take root and be most enduring and most valuable. First, then. I will say to you my young friends--and I say it beseechingly, urgingly-- \n\u003eAlways obey your parents, when they are present. This is the best policy in the long run, because if you don‚Äôt, they will make you. Most parents think they know better than you do, and you can generally make more by humoring that superstition than you can by acting on your own better judgment. Be respectful to your superiors, if you have any, also to strangers, and sometimes to others. If a person offend you, and you are in doubt as to whether it was intentional or not, do not resort to extreme measures; simply watch your chance and hit him with a brick. That will be sufficient. If you shall find that he had not intended any offense, come out frankly and confess yourself in the wrong when you struck him; acknowledge it like a man and say you didn‚Äôt mean to. Yes, always avoid violence; in this age of charity and kindliness, the time has gone by for such things. Leave dynamite to the low and unrefined. \n\u003eGo to bed early, get up early--this is wise. Some authorities say get up with the sun; some say get up with one thing, others with another. But a lark is really the best thing to get up with. It gives you a splendid reputation with everybody to \nknow that you get up with the lark; and if you get the right kind of lark, and work at him right, you can easily train him to get up at half past nine, every time--it‚Äôs no trick at all. \nNow as to the matter of lying. You want to be very careful about lying; otherwise you are nearly sure to get caught. Once caught, you can never again be in the eyes to the good and the pure, what you were before. Many a young person has injured himself permanently through a single clumsy and ill finished lie, the result of carelessness born of incomplete training. Some authorities hold that the young ought not to lie at all. That of course, is putting it rather stronger than necessary; still while I cannot go quite so far as that, I do maintain, and I believe I am right, that the young ought to be temperate in the use of this great art until practice and experience shall give them that confidence, elegance, and precision which alone can make the accomplishment graceful and profitable. Patience, diligence, painstaking attention to detail--these are requirements; these in time, will make the \nstudent perfect; upon these only, may he rely as the sure foundation for future \neminence. Think what tedious years of study, thought, practice, experience, went to the equipment of that peerless old master who was able to impose upon the whole world the lofty and sounding maxim that ‚ÄúTruth is mighty and will prevail‚Äù--the most majestic compound fracture of fact which any of woman born has yet achieved. For the history of our race, and each individual‚Äôs experience, are sewn thick with evidences that a truth is not hard to kill, and that a lie well told is immortal. There is in Boston a monument of the man who discovered anesthesia; many people are aware, in these latter days, that that man didn‚Äôt discover it at all, but stole the discovery from another man. Is this truth mighty, and will it prevail? \nAh no, my hearers, the monument is made of hardy material, but the lie it tells will outlast it a million years. An awkward, feeble, leaky lie is a thing which you ought to make it your unceasing study to avoid; such a lie as that has no more real permanence than an average truth. Why, you might as well tell the truth at once and be done with it. A feeble, stupid, preposterous lie will not live two years--\nexcept it be a slander upon somebody. It is indestructible, then of course, but that is no merit of yours. A final word: begin your practice of this gracious and beautiful art early--begin now. If I had begun earlier, I could have learned how. \nNever handle firearms carelessly. The sorrow and suffering that have been caused through the innocent but heedless handling of firearms by the young! Only four days ago, right in the next farm house to the one where I am spending the summer, a grandmother, old and gray and sweet, one of the loveliest spirits in the land, was sitting at her work, when her young grandson crept in and got down an old, battered, rusty gun which had not been touched for many years and was supposed not to be loaded, and pointed it at her, laughing and threatening to shoot. In her \nfright she ran screaming and pleading toward the door on the other side of the \nroom; but as she passed him he placed the gun almost against her very breast and pulled the trigger! He had supposed it was not loaded. And he was right--it wasn‚Äôt. So there wasn‚Äôt any harm done. It is the only case of that kind I ever heard of. \nTherefore, just the same, don‚Äôt you meddle with old unloaded firearms; they are the most deadly and unerring things that have ever been created by man. You don‚Äôt have to take any pains at all with them; you don‚Äôt have to have a rest, you don‚Äôt have to have any sights on the gun, you don‚Äôt have to take aim, even. No, you just pick out a relative and bang away, and you are sure to get him. A youth who can‚Äôt hit a cathedral at thirty yards with a Gatling gun in three quarters of an hour, can take up an old empty musket and bag his grandmother every time, at a hundred. \nThink what Waterloo would have been if one of the armies had been boys armed with old muskets supposed not to be loaded, and the other army had been composed of their female relations. The very thought of it make one shudder. \nThere are many sorts of books; but good ones are the sort for the young to read. Remember that. They are a great, an inestimable, and unspeakable means of improvement. Therefore be careful in your selection, my young friends; be very careful; confine yourselves exclusively to Robertson‚Äôs Sermons, Baxter‚Äôs Saint‚Äôs Rest, The Innocents Abroad, and works of that kind. \nBut I have said enough. I hope you will treasure up the instructions which I have given you, and make them a guide to your feet and a light to your understanding. \nBuild your character thoughtfully and painstakingly upon these precepts, and by and by, when you have got it built, you will be surprised and gratified to see how nicely and sharply it resembles everybody else‚Äôs.\n\n\n1. Obedience towards parents \n\tonly when they're watching\n\n2. Being respectful to others\n\tdon't strike immediately, wait for the perfect time\n\n3. Go to bed early, get up early \n\n4. Lying\n\n5.

The tale is about  \nan old woman who knew an interesting story but refused to  \nshare it with others. Ironically, that story slipped out of the  \nsnoring old hag‚Äüs mouth and is transformed into a beautiful  \nyoung lady and the song that accompanies it, turns into a  \nbeautiful sari.\nThus, the fourth narrative level is the story of Rani, the lady  \nwho born out of the story from the old hag‚Äüs mouth.

This animal, in many ways so superior, has accepted a position of inferiority, shares the domestic life, and humours the caprices of the tyrant. But the potentate[^potentate], like the British in India, pays small regard to the character of his willing client, judges him with listless glances, and condemns him in a byword. Listless have been the looks of his admirers, who have exhausted idle terms of praise, and buried the poor soul below exaggerations. And yet more idle and, if possible, more unintelligent has been the attitude of his express detractors; those who are very fond of dogs \"but in their proper place\"; who say \"poo' fellow, poo' fellow,\" and are themselves far poorer; who whet the knife of the vivisectionist or heat his oven;[^2] who are not ashamed to admire \"the creature's instinct\"; and flying far beyond folly, have dared to resuscitate the theory of animal machines. The \"dog's instinct\" and the \"automaton-dog,\" in this age of psychology and science, sound like strange anachronisms. An automaton he certainly is; a machine working independently of his control, the heart like the mill-wheel, keeping all in motion, and the consciousness, like a person shut in the mill garret, enjoying the view out of the window and shaken by the thunder of the stones; an automaton in one corner of which a living spirit is confined: an automaton like man. Instinct again he certainly possesses. Inherited aptitudes are his, inherited frailties. Some things he at once views and understands, as though he were awakened from a sleep, as though he came \"trailing clouds of glory.\"[^3] But with him, as with man, the field of instinct is limited; its utterances are obscure and occasional; and about the far larger part of life both the dog and his master must conduct their steps by deduction and observation.\n\nThe leading distinction[^4] between dog and man, after and perhaps before the different duration of their lives, is that the one can speak and that the other cannot. The absence of the power of speech confines the dog in the development of his intellect. It hinders him from many speculations, for words are the beginning of metaphysic. At the same blow it saves him from many superstitions, and his silence has won for him a higher name for virtue than his conduct justifies. The faults of the dog[^5] are many. \n\nHe is vainer than man, singularly greedy of notice, singularly intolerant of ridicule, suspicious like the deaf, jealous to the degree of frenzy, and radically devoid of truth. The day of an intelligent small dog is passed in the manufacture and the laborious communication of falsehood; he lies with his tail, he lies with his eye, he lies with his protesting paw; and when he rattles his dish or scratches at the door his purpose is other than appears. But he has some apology to offer for the vice. Many of the signs which form his dialect have come to bear an arbitrary meaning, clearly understood both by his master and himself; yet when a new want arises he must either invent a new vehicle of meaning or wrest an old one to a different purpose; and this necessity frequently recurring must tend to lessen his idea of the sanctity of symbols. Meanwhile the dog is clear in his own conscience, and draws, with a human nicety, the distinction between formal and essential truth. Of his punning perversions, his legitimate dexterity with symbols, he is even vain; but when he has told and been detected in a lie, there is not a hair upon his body but confesses guilt. To a dog of gentlemanly feeling theft and falsehood are disgraceful vices. The canine, like the human, gentleman demands in his misdemeanours Montaigne's \"je ne sais quoi de gen√©r√©ux.\"[^6] \n\nHe is never more than half ashamed of having barked or bitten; and for those faults into which he has been led by the desire to shine before a lady of his race, he retains, even under physical correction, a share of pride. But to be caught lying, if he understands it, instantly uncurls his fleece. Just as among dull observers he preserves a name for truth, the dog has been credited with modesty. It is amazing how the use of language blunts the faculties of man‚Äî-that because vainglory finds no vent in words, creatures supplied with eyes have been unable to detect a fault so gross and obvious. If a small spoiled dog were suddenly to be endowed with speech, he would prate interminably, and still about himself; when we had friends, we should be forced to lock him in a garret; and what with his whining jealousies and his foible for falsehood, in a year's time he would have gone far to weary out our love. I was about to compare him to Sir Willoughby Patterne,[^7] but the Patternes have a manlier sense of their own merits; and the parallel, besides, is ready. Hans Christian Andersen,[^8] as we behold him in his startling memoirs, thrilling from top to toe with an excruciating vanity, and scouting even along the street for shadows of offence‚Äîhere was the talking dog.\n\nIt is just this rage for consideration that has betrayed the dog into his satellite position as the friend of man. The cat, an animal of franker appetites, preserves his independence. But the dog, with one eye ever on the audience, has been wheedled into slavery, and praised and patted into the renunciation of his nature. Once he ceased hunting[^9] and became man's plate-licker, the Rubicon was crossed. Thenceforth he was a gentleman of leisure; and except the few whom we keep working, the whole race grew more and more self-conscious, mannered and affected. The number of things that a small dog does naturally is strangely small. Enjoying better spirits and not crushed under material cares, he is far more theatrical than average man. His whole life, if he be a dog of any pretension to gallantry, is spent in a vain show, and in the hot pursuit of admiration. Take out your puppy for a walk, and you will find the little ball of fur clumsy, stupid, bewildered, but natural. Let but a few months pass, and when you repeat the process you will find nature buried in convention. He will do nothing plainly; but the simplest processes of our material life will all be bent into the forms of an elaborate and mysterious etiquette. Instinct, says the fool, has awakened. But it is not so. Some dogs‚Äîsome, at the very least‚Äîif they be kept separate from others, remain quite natural; and these, when at length they meet with a companion of experience, and have the game explained to them, distinguish themselves by the severity of their devotion to its rules. \n\nI wish I were allowed to tell a story which would radiantly illuminate the point; but men, like dogs, have an elaborate and mysterious etiquette. It is their bond of sympathy that both are the children of convention.\n\nThe person, man or dog, who has a conscience is eternally condemned to some degree of humbug; the sense of the law in their members[^10] fatally precipitates either towards a frozen and affected bearing. And the converse is true; and in the elaborate and conscious manners of the dog, moral opinions and the love of the ideal stand confessed. To follow for ten minutes in the street some swaggering, canine cavalier, is to receive a lesson in dramatic art and the cultured conduct of the body; in every act and gesture you see him true to a refined conception; and the dullest cur, beholding him, pricks up his ear and proceeds to imitate and parody that charming ease. \n\nFor to be a high-mannered and high-minded gentleman, careless, affable, and gay, is the inborn pretension of the dog. The large dog, so much lazier, so much more weighed upon with matter, so majestic in repose, so beautiful in effort, is born with the dramatic means to wholly represent the part. And it is more pathetic and perhaps more instructive to consider the small dog in his conscientious and imperfect efforts to outdo Sir Philip Sidney.[^11] For the ideal of the dog is feudal and religious;[^12] the ever-present polytheism, the whip-bearing Olympus of mankind, rules them on the one hand; on the other, their singular difference of size and strength among themselves effectually prevents the appearance of the democratic notion. \n\nOr we might more exactly compare their society to the curious spectacle presented by a school‚Äîushers, monitors, and big and little boys‚Äîqualified by one circumstance, the introduction of the other sex. In each, we should observe a somewhat similar tension of manner, and somewhat similar points of honour. In each the larger animal keeps a contemptuous good humour; in each the smaller annoys him with wasp-like impudence, certain of practical immunity; in each we shall find a double life producing double characters, and an excursive and noisy heroism combined with a fair amount of practical timidity. I have known dogs, and I have known school heroes that, set aside the fur, could hardly have been told apart; and if we desire to understand the chivalry of old, we must turn to the school playfields or the dungheap where the dogs are trooping.\n\nWoman, with the dog, has been long enfranchised. Incessant massacre of female innocents has changed the proportions of the sexes and perverted their relations. [^women]\n\nThus, when we regard the manners of the dog, we see a romantic and monogamous animal, once perhaps as delicate as the cat, at war with impossible conditions. Man has much to answer for; and the part he plays is yet more damnable and parlous[^13] than Corin's in the eyes of Touchstone. But his intervention has at least created an imperial situation for the rare surviving ladies. In that society they reign without a rival: conscious queens; and in the only instance of a canine wife-beater that has ever fallen under my notice, the criminal was somewhat excused by the circumstances of his story. He is a little, very alert, well-bred, intelligent Skye, as black as a hat, with a wet bramble for a nose and two cairn-gorms[^14] for eyes. \n\nTo the human observer, he is decidedly well-looking; but to the ladies of his race he seems abhorrent. A thorough elaborate gentleman, of the plume and sword-knot order, he was born with the nice sense of gallantry to women. He took at their hands the most outrageous treatment; I have heard him bleating like a sheep, I have seen him streaming blood, and his ear tattered like a regimental banner; and yet he would scorn to make reprisals. Nay more, when a human lady upraised the contumelious whip against the very dame who had been so cruelly misusing him, my little great-heart gave but one hoarse cry and fell upon the tyrant tooth and nail. This is the tale of a soul's tragedy.[^15] After three years of unavailing chivalry, he suddenly, in one hour, threw off the yoke of obligation; had he been Shakespeare he would then have written Troilus and Cressida[^16] to brand the offending sex; but being only a little dog, he began to bite them. The surprise of the ladies whom he attacked indicated the monstrosity of his offence; but he had fairly beaten off his better angel, fairly committed moral suicide; for almost in the same hour, throwing aside the last rags of decency, he proceeded to attack the aged also. The fact is worth remark, showing as it does, that ethical laws are common both to dogs and men; and that with both a single deliberate violation of the conscience loosens all. \n\n\"But while the lamp holds on to burn,\" says the paraphrase, \"the greatest sinner may return.\"[^17] I have been cheered to see symptoms of effectual penitence in my sweet ruffian; and by the handling that he accepted uncomplainingly the other day from an indignant fair one, I begin to hope the period of Sturm und Drang[^18] is closed.\n\nAll these little gentlemen are subtle casuists. The duty to the female dog is plain; but where competing duties rise, down they will sit and study them out like Jesuit confessors.[^19] I knew another little Skye, somewhat plain in manner and appearance, but a creature compact of amiability and solid wisdom. His family going abroad for a winter, he was received for that period by an uncle in the same city. The winter over, his own family home again, and his own house (of which he was very proud) reopened, he found himself in a dilemma between two conflicting duties of loyalty and gratitude. His old friends were not to be neglected, but it seemed hardly decent to desert the new. This was how he solved the problem. Every morning, as soon as the door was opened, off posted Coolin to his uncle's, visited the children in the nursery, saluted the whole family, and was back at home in time for breakfast and his bit of fish. \n\nNor was this done without a sacrifice on his part, sharply felt; for he had to forego the particular honour and jewel of his day‚Äîhis morning's walk with my father. And perhaps, from this cause, he gradually wearied of and relaxed the practice, and at length returned entirely to his ancient habits. But the same decision served him in another and more distressing case of divided duty, which happened not long after. He was not at all a kitchen dog, but the cook had nursed him with unusual kindness during the distemper; and though he did not adore her as he adored my father‚Äîalthough (born snob) he was critically conscious of her position as \"only a servant\"‚Äîhe still cherished for her a special gratitude. Well, the cook left, and retired some streets away to lodgings of her own; and there was Coolin in precisely the same situation with any young gentleman who has had the inestimable benefit of a faithful nurse. \n\nThe canine conscience did not solve the problem with a pound of tea at Christmas. No longer content to pay a flying visit, it was the whole forenoon that he dedicated to his solitary friend. And so, day by day, he continued to comfort her solitude until (for some reason which I could never understand and cannot approve) he was kept locked up to break him of the graceful habit. Here, it is not the similarity, it is the difference, that is worthy of remark; the clearly marked degrees of gratitude and the proportional duration of his visits. Anything further removed from instinct it were hard to fancy; and one is even stirred to a certain impatience with a character so destitute of spontaneity, so passionless in justice, and so priggishly obedient to the voice of reason.\n\nThere are not many dogs like this good Coolin. and not many people. But the type is one well marked, both in the human and the canine family. Gallantry was not his aim, but a solid and somewhat oppressive respectability. He was a sworn foe to the unusual and the conspicuous, a praiser of the golden mean, a kind of city uncle modified by Cheeryble.[^20] And as he was precise and conscientious in all the steps of his own blameless course, he looked for the same precision and an even greater gravity in the bearing of his deity, my father. It was no sinecure to be Coolin's idol; he was exacting like a rigid parent; and at every sign of levity in the man whom he respected, he announced loudly the death of virtue and the proximate fall of the pillars of the earth.\n\nI have called him a snob; but all dogs are so, though in varying degrees. It is hard to follow their snobbery among themselves; for though I think we can perceive distinctions of rank, we cannot grasp what is the criterion. Thus in Edinburgh, in a good part of the town, there were several distinct societies or clubs that met in the morning to‚Äîthe phrase is technical‚Äîto \"rake the backets\"[^21] in a troop. A friend of mine, the master of three dogs, was one day surprised to observe that they had left one club and joined another; but whether it was a rise or a fall, and the result of an invitation or an expulsion, was more than he could guess. And this illustrates pointedly our ignorance of the real life of dogs, their social ambitions and their social hierarchies. At least, in their dealings with men they are not only conscious of sex, but of the difference of station. And that in the most snobbish manner; for the poor man's dog is not offended by the notice of the rich, and keeps all his ugly feeling for those poorer or more ragged than his master. And again, for every station they have an ideal of behaviour, to which the master, under pain of derogation, will do wisely to conform. How often has not a cold glance of an eye informed me that my dog was disappointed; and how much more gladly would he not have taken a beating than to be thus wounded in the seat of piety!\n\nI knew one disrespectable dog. He was far liker a cat; cared little or nothing for men, with whom he merely coexisted as we do with cattle, and was entirely devoted to the art of poaching. A house would not hold him, and to live in a town was what he refused. He led, I believe, a life of troubled but genuine pleasure, and perished beyond all question in a trap. But this was an exception, a marked reversion to the ancestral type; like the hairy human infant. The true dog of the nineteenth century, to judge by the remainder of my fairly large acquaintance, is in love with respectability. A street-dog was once adopted by a lady. While still an Arab, he had done as Arabs do, gambolling in the mud, charging into butchers' stalls, a cat-hunter, a sturdy beggar, a common rogue and vagabond; but with his rise into society he laid aside these inconsistent pleasures. He stole no more, he hunted no more cats; and conscious of his collar he ignored his old companions. Yet the canine upper class was never brought to recognize the upstart, and from that hour, except for human countenance, he was alone. Friendless, shorn of his sports and the habits of a lifetime, he still lived in a glory of happiness, content with his acquired respectability, and with no care but to support it solemnly. Are we to condemn or praise this self-made dog! We praise his human brother. And thus to conquer vicious habits is as rare with dogs as with men. With the more part, for all their scruple-mongering and moral thought, the vices that are born with them remain invincible throughout; and they live all their years, glorying in their virtues, but still the slaves of their defects. Thus the sage Coolin was a thief to the last; among a thousand peccadilloes, a whole goose and a whole cold leg of mutton lay upon his conscience; but Woggs,[^22] whose soul's shipwreck in the matter of gallantry I have recounted above, has only twice been known to steal, and has often nobly conquered the temptation. The eighth is his favourite commandment. There is something painfully human in these unequal virtues and mortal frailties of the best. Still more painful is the bearing of those \"stammering professors\"[^23] in the house of sickness and under the terror of death. It is beyond a doubt to me that, somehow or other, the dog connects together, or confounds, the uneasiness of sickness and the consciousness of guilt. To the pains of the body he often adds the tortures of the conscience; and at these times his haggard protestations form, in regard to the human deathbed, a dreadful parody or parallel.\n\nI once supposed that I had found an inverse relation between the double etiquette which dogs obey; and that those who were most addicted to the showy street life among other dogs were less careful in the practice of home virtues for the tyrant man. But the female dog, that mass of carneying[^24] affectations, shines equally in either sphere; rules her rough posse of attendant swains with unwearying tact and gusto; and with her master and mistress pushes the arts of insinuation to their crowning point. The attention of man and the regard of other dogs flatter (it would thus appear) the same sensibility; but perhaps, if we could read the canine heart, they would be found to flatter it in very marked degrees. \n\nDogs live with man as courtiers round a monarch, steeped in the flattery of his notice and enriched with sinecures. To push their favour in this world of pickings and caresses is, perhaps, the business of their lives; and their joys may lie outside. I am in despair at our persistent ignorance. I read in the lives of our companions the same processes of reason, the same antique and fatal conflicts of the right against the wrong, and of unbitted nature with too rigid custom; I see them with our weaknesses, vain, false, inconstant against appetite, and with our one stalk of virtue, devoted to the dream of an ideal; and yet, as they hurry by me on the street with tail in air, or come singly to solicit my regard, I must own the secret purport of their lives is still inscrutable to man. \n\nIs man the friend, or is he the patron only? Have they indeed forgotten nature's voice? or are those moments snatched from courtiership when they touch noses with the tinker's mongrel, the brief reward and pleasure of their artificial lives?\n\nDoubtless, when man shares with his dog the toils of a profession and the pleasures of an art, as with the shepherd or the poacher, the affection warms and strengthens till it fills the soul. But doubtless, also, the masters are, in many cases, the object of a merely interested cultus, sitting aloft like Louis Quatorze,[^25] giving and receiving flattery and favour; and the dogs, like the majority of men, have but forgotten their true existence and become the dupes of their ambition.\n\n---\n\nThis article originally appeared in The English Illustrated Magazine for May 1883, Vol. I, pp. 300-305. It was accompanied with illustrations by Randolph Caldecott. The essay was later included in the volume Memories and Portraits (1887).\n\nThe astonishing fidelity and devotion of the dog to his master have certainly been in part repaid by men of letters in all times. A valuable essay might be written on the Dog's Place in Literature; in the poetry of the East, hundreds of years before Christ, the dog's faithfulness was more than once celebrated. One of the most marvellous passages in Homer's Odyssey is the recognition of the ragged Ulysses by the noble old dog, who dies of joy. In recent years, since the publication of Dr. John Brown's Rab and his Friends (1858), the dog has approached an apotheosis. Among innumerable sketches and stories with canine heroes may be mentioned Bret Harte's extraordinary portrait of Boonder: M. Maeterlinck's essay on dogs: Richard Harding Davis's The Bar Sinister: Jack London's The Call of the Wild: and best of all, Alfred Ollivant's splendid story Bob, Son of Battle (1898) which has every indication of becoming an English classic. It is a pity that dogs cannot read.\n\n---\n\n[^1]:  The morals of dog-kind. Stevenson discusses this subject again in his essay Pulvis et Umbra (1888).\n\n\n[^2]:  Who whet the knife of the vivisectionist or heat his oven. Stevenson was so sympathetic by nature that once, seeing a man beating a dog, he interfered, crying, \"It's not your dog, it's God's dog.\" On the subject of vivisection, however his biographer says: \"It must be laid to the credit of his reason and the firm balance of his judgment that although vivisection was a subject he could not endure even to have mentioned, yet, with all his imagination and sensibility, he never ranged himself among the opponents of this method of inquiry, provided, of course, it was limited, as in England, with the utmost rigour possible.\"‚ÄîBalfour's Life, II, 217. The two most powerful opponents of vivisection among Stevenson's contemporaries were Ruskin and Browning. The former resigned the Professorship of Poetry at Oxford because vivisection was permitted at the University: and the latter in two poems Tray and Arcades Ambo treated the vivisectionists with contempt, implying that they were cowards. In Bernard Shaw's clever novel Cashel Byron's Profession, The prize-fighter maintains that his profession is more honorable than that of a man who bakes dogs in an oven. This novel, by the way, which he read in the winter of 1887-88, made an extraordinary impression on Stevenson; he recognised its author's originality and cleverness immediately, and was filled with curiosity as to what kind of person this Shaw might be. \"Tell me more of the inimitable author,\" he cried. It is a pity that Stevenson did not live to see the vogue of Shaw as a dramatist, for the latter's early novels produced practically no impression on the public. See Stevenson's highly entertaining letter to William Archer, Letters, II, 107.\n\n[^3]: \"Trailing clouds of glory.\" Trailing with him clouds of glory.

Stevenson argues that dogs are not mere instinctive machines, but intelligent and emotional beings who have adapted to human civilization and culture. He praises dogs for their loyalty, courage, affection and sense of humor, but also acknowledges their flaws such as vanity, jealousy, greed and dishonesty. He compares dogs with different breeds, countries and historical periods, and illustrates his points with anecdotes and observations. He concludes by expressing his admiration and love for dogs, and his hope that they will be treated with kindness and respect by their masters.\n\n# Important Lines\n\nThis animal, in many ways so superior, has accepted a position of inferiority, shares the domestic life, and humours the caprices of the tyrant \n\nBut the potentate, like the British in India, pays small regard to the character of his willing client, judges him with listless glances, and condemns him in a byword\n\nThe leading distinction between dog and man, after and perhaps before the different duration of their lives, is **that the one can speak and that the other cannot**.\n\nThe absence of the power of speech confines the dog in the development of his intellect. It hinders him from many speculations, for words are the beginning of metaphysic. \n**saves them from superstitions** \n\n\"fauilts of dogs\" - \n**He is vainer than man, singularly greedy of notice, singularly intolerant of ridicule, suspicious like the deaf, jealous to the degree of frenzy, and radically devoid of truth**\n\nMany of the signs which form his dialect have come to bear an arbitrary meaning, clearly understood both by his master and himself; yet when a new want arises he must either invent a new vehicle of meaning or wrest an old one to a different purpose; and this necessity frequently recurring must tend to lessen his idea of the sanctity of symbols.\n\nIt is amazing how the use of language blunts the faculties of man‚Äî-that because vainglory finds no vent in words, creatures supplied with eyes have been unable to detect a fault so gross and obvious. \n\nIf a small spoiled dog were suddenly to be endowed with speech, he would prate interminably, and still about himself; when we had friends, we should be forced to lock him in a garret; and what with his whining jealousies and his foible for falsehood, in a year's time he would have gone far to weary out our love. [^explanation1]\n\nI was about to compare him to Sir Willoughby Patterne, but the Patternes have a manlier sense of their own merits; and the parallel, besides, is ready. Hans Christian Andersen, as we behold him in his startling memoirs, thrilling from top to toe with an excruciating vanity, and scouting even along the street for shadows of offence‚Äîhere was the talking dog.\n\nThe cat, an animal of franker appetites, preserves his independence. But the dog, with one eye ever on the audience, has been wheedled into slavery, and praised and patted into the renunciation of his nature.\n\nOnce he ceased hunting and became man's plate-licker, the Rubicon was crossed.\n\nHis whole life, if he be a dog of any pretension to gallantry, is spent in a vain show, and in the hot pursuit of admiration.\n \nAnd it is more pathetic and perhaps more instructive to consider the small dog in his conscientious and imperfect efforts to outdo Sir Philip Sidney\n\n**For the ideal of the dog is feudal and religious; the ever-present polytheism, the whip-bearing Olympus of mankind, rules them on the one hand; on the other, their singular difference of size and strength among themselves effectually prevents the appearance of the democratic notion.**\n\n*He means that dogs have a worldview that is based on hierarchy and obedience. He compares **humans to a group of gods who have absolute power and authority over dogs**, and who can reward or punish them at will. He says that dogs are faithful and devoted to their human masters, and that they accept their position of inferiority and dependence. He also says that dogs have no sense of equality or democracy among themselves, because they vary so much in size and strength. He implies that dogs are ruled by fear and respect, and that they do not challenge or question the established order.*\n\n\n**Compares dogs to boys in school**\n in each we shall find a double life producing double characters, and an excursive and noisy heroism combined with a fair amount of practical timidity. I have known dogs, and I have known school heroes that, set aside the fur, could hardly have been told apart; and if we desire to understand the chivalry of old, we must turn to the school playfields or the dungheap where the dogs are trooping.\n\n\n\n**The fact is worth remark, showing as it does, that ethical laws are common both to dogs and men; and that with both a single deliberate violation of the conscience loosens all.**\n\nAll these little gentlemen are subtle casuists. The duty to the female dog is plain; but where competing duties rise, down they will sit and study them out like Jesuit confessors\n\ncasuist - person who uses clever but unsound reasoning\n\n*Stevenson calls dogs casuists in this essay because they are **subtle reasoners** who try to justify their actions and **resolve moral dilemmas**. He gives examples of how dogs balance their loyalty and gratitude to different human friends, or how they distinguish between formal and essential truth when they lie or deceive. **He implies that dogs have a conscience and a sense of honor, but also a flexible morality that adapts to circumstances.** \n\ndogs are (born snob)\n\nAnd that in the most snobbish manner; for the poor man's dog is not offended by the notice of the rich, and keeps all his ugly feeling for those poorer or more ragged than his master.\n\n*He suggests that dogs are influenced by human society and culture, and that they adopt its values and prejudices.*\n\n[^explanation1]: Stevenson means that humans are often blind to the vanity and selfishness of dogs, because dogs cannot express their thoughts and feelings in words. He thinks that if dogs could talk, they would reveal their true nature, which is full of pride, envy, and lies. He imagines that a spoiled dog who could talk would annoy and bore his human friends with his endless chatter about himself, and that they would soon lose their affection for him. He implies that dogs are better off being silent, because their silence makes them more lovable and respectable.\n\n[^overall]: - I partially agree with Stevenson‚Äôs view of dogs. I think he is right that dogs have complex personalities and emotions, and that they are not mere instinctive machines. I also think he is right that dogs are influenced by human society and culture, and that they have adapted to human civilization and manners. However, I think he is too harsh and cynical in his judgment of dogs‚Äô faults. I think he exaggerates the vanity, jealousy, and dishonesty of dogs, and overlooks their virtues. I think he fails to appreciate the diversity and individuality of dogs, and generalizes too much from his own experience. I think he is biased by his own human perspective, and does not try to understand dogs on their own terms. I think dogs are more than silent companions or spoiled children; they are intelligent and loyal partners who can enrich our lives with their love and joy.\n\n# Important Points \n-   Stevenson explores the similarities and differences between dogs and humans, especially in their moral and social qualities.\n-   He argues that dogs are influenced by their relationship with humans, who have made them into slaves and companions, but also by their own natural instincts and preferences.\n-   He describes various types of dogs, such as the small dog who is vain and deceitful, the large dog who is majestic and dignified, the snobbish dog who cares for respectability, and the disrespectable dog who lives as a poacher.\n-   He admires the dog‚Äôs sense of loyalty, gratitude, and chivalry, but also criticizes his vices of vanity, greediness, jealousy, and falsehood.\n-   He compares the dog‚Äôs society to that of a school or a feudal system, where there are ranks, clubs, codes of honour, and ideals of behaviour.\n-   He concludes that dogs are not mere machines or instinctive animals, but complex and intelligent creatures who have a conscience and a character.\n- He is talking about how the relationship between dogs and humans varies depending on their occupation and lifestyle. He says that when a man and his dog work together and share a common interest, such as a shepherd or a poacher, their bond becomes stronger and deeper. They become true friends and partners, who understand and appreciate each other. But he also says that in many cases, the masters are like kings who demand and give loyalty and praise, and the dogs are like subjects who have lost their true identity and become slaves to their ambition. They worship their masters for their power and status, but they do not have a genuine connection or respect. He implies that this is a sad and false situation, where both the dogs and the humans are deceived by their vanity and pride.\n\n\n\n[^women]:He is talking about how humans have interfered with the natural balance of the dog population by killing many female dogs for various reasons. He says that this has made the female dogs very rare and valuable in the dog society, where they are treated like queens by the male dogs. He compares this situation to the human society, where women have been oppressed and exploited by men for a long time. He also mentions a literary reference to Shakespeare‚Äôs play ‚ÄúAs You Like It‚Äù, where Corin is a simple shepherd who does not understand the sophisticated manners of Touchstone, a court jester. He implies that humans are like Touchstone, who mocks and criticizes Corin for his ignorance and simplicity. He says that humans have a worse and more dangerous role than Corin, because they have harmed and corrupted the dog‚Äôs nature. He also gives an example of a rare case of a dog who abused his female partner, but he says that there was some justification for his behavior because of his past history.\n\n\nCanine wife-beater?\nHe is a little black Skye terrier who was once kidnapped and tortured by some boys. He managed to escape and return to his owners, but he became very nervous and irritable. He would often snap at his female partner, a gentle and beautiful Skye terrier, and sometimes even bite her. Stevenson says that he was somewhat excused by the circumstances of his story, but he also says that he was ashamed of his behavior and would try to make up for it by being more affectionate and attentive to his partner.\n\nWoggs \nWoggs, who was very polite and chivalrous to female dogs. He says that Woggs was a gentleman who wore a feather and a ribbon on his collar, and he had a high sense of honour and respect for women. He says that Woggs would endure any abuse or injury from female dogs without fighting back or complaining. He gives an example of how Woggs was once attacked by a female dog who bit his ear and made him bleed. But when a human woman tried to whip the female dog for her bad behavior, Woggs defended her and attacked the woman instead. He says that this is the story of a **soul‚Äôs tragedy**, meaning that Woggs was a noble and loyal dog who suffered because of his love and devotion to female dogs\n\n## dogs he mentions \nWoggs \nSkye terrier that was a gentleman \n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.25916539Z","tags":null},"/Theater-Of-Absurd":{"title":"Theater of Absurd","content":"\n\n## Anti-Language\n- No fixed pattern \n- Characters talk disorderly \n  What the character has said is not the words that his partner has asked or wanted to get.

They don't live long. No queen means no males.\nWhat's interesting is societal roles of ants within the colony. Each any has a specific role within the colony. These would appear to be a collective of foragers. They ate either all from the same colony or they are Argentine ants. Ants produce pheromones. Most ants if the same species but of different colonies will fight and kill each other. Argentine ants are the only known species that don't do this and we don't know why. In theory, all Argentine ants form a single colony which would be insane because they are found on multiple continents.\nAnts death spirals exist so this single instance of these ants operating without a queen is the only known example of this behavior in ants in the entire world, as to my knowledge. I'm an exterminator just shy of a decade in the industry. I have no degree in entomology, so there are many much more knowledgeable folks than myself.\nTermite colonies have complex climate control that includes bringing moisture with them wherever the colony expands.\nSolitary wasps produce no known allergens.\nWolf spider and yellow sack spider bite can cause necrosis if the person bitten reacts badly. Not as bad as a brown recluse bite, but still, necrosis is necrosis.\nDelusional parasitosis, forgive my spelling, is very real and surprisingly common.\nLice prefer clean hair over dirty hair.\nBedbugs have sex organs but typically breed by the male literally just stabbing a female with his spike like penis in a process called traumatic insemination and a theory as to why bedbugs spread in the manner that they do could suggest its the females trying to get away from the males.\"*  \n\n*\"Simply, interesting facts about a variety if insects that most people don't know.\nI've forgotten more about insects than most will learn in a lifetime. I can talk for hours about pest control. I'd say the majority of exterminators that have more than a few years in can do the same. We don't bring it up unless asked. Most people don't have a clue as RI the extensive knowledge their exterminator actually has. The majority of what we do is simply maintence.\nThe insect world is vast. There are so many different insects even regionally, not to mentioned rarity of various species. I dont come across many new insects anymore, the ones I do happen to be very rare in my region. At this point, the things that surprise me tend to be new places I've found bugs. I've seen ant colony is working and running aquarium aerators. I found a colony living underneath the glass of an aquarium. They were almost completely contained living along the exterior. They collected food from spilled fish food, moisture from condensate off the glass as well as moisture from the tank itself. I had my suspicions on bedbugs feeding off creatures other than humans before the science suggested it was possible, through my own observations. I had a really bad bedbug job, possibly the worst one I've ever seen. I found them living in a bird cage and 2 pet carriers for dogs. Until this point, the science said they didn't do that. There is something called a bat bug that looks damn near identical to a bedbug that feeds off of bats. We know they will take a blood meal off of humans but require bat blood to reproduce and complete their stage changes. Seemed to me that despite what the science said, in a similar situation, bedbugs could take a blood meal from a different source, but still require human blood to reproduce and also complete their stage changes. I found a type of solitary Prarie bee that prefers a specific soil composition to build their nest. An entire half acre plot land with a hole about every square inch. Thousands of these things took over these peoples yard. They run for about 6 weeks in the spring. I had one and another tech had one at the same time in a different location. I've only ever seen this once and I've never seen anything quite like it. Cicada killers behave in a similar manner, they also run about 6 weeks in my region, just in late summer, but you never see those kinds of number. 30 in a yard is a lot. I ended up calling the Perdue University Department of Entomology amd spoke with a grad student working on a PH.D. The gentleman ended up doing some quick research for me and found a paper written by someone with a Doctorates in Entomology about having the same issues in his garden. Absolutely fascinating stuff, and begged me not to kill them as loss of habitat has forced them into situations like this. They aren't endangered yet, but they are in that path. I explained the situation to the home owner and gave them some other compromised solutions that they decided to try. I told them I would kill them if they truly wanted me to, but they would come back. The solution is changing the soil composition, they ended up mulching an area for the kids and dogs to play in and let the bee have their 6 weeks with the rest of the yard. That one left me all warm and fuzzy. It's not often we get to find a solution like that. The bees were happy the homeowner was happy.\nIf you want to know about all the insect and insect eggs you eat on a daily basis, message me. Those discussions tend to freak people out. I warn you, I will tell you what I know about this stuff if you really want to know it but you won't look at a variety of foods the same.\nI can also tell you how to inspect second hand furniture for cockroaches and bedbugs before purchase. I can walk you through bedbug inspections for hotel rooms. I can tell you what to look for in restaurants. I can tell you which over the counter pesticides and rodenticides work and don't work. I can discuss, in depth and detail the behavioral patterns of a variety of pests, mice and rats included, which will typically increase the number you kill with snap traps and catch with glue boards.\nI can tell you vibrators are susceptible to bedbug infestation. I can tell you the dumb shit people think will work to combat their pest issues. I can also discuss the pros and cons of 25(b) exempt products (essential oil pesticides) I can tell you organic foods are still sprayed with pesticides, just not synthetic pesticides.\nThis is a wonderful tip.

Le Guin's The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction, 1986**\n\n---\nIn the temperate and tropical regions where it appears that hominids evolved into human beings, the principal food of the species was vegetable. Sixty-five to eighty percent of what human beings ate in those regions in Paleolithic, Neolithic, and prehistoric times was gathered; only in the extreme Arctic was meat the staple food. The mammoth hunters spectacularly occupy the cave wall and the mind, but what we actually did to stay alive and fat was gather seeds, roots, sprouts, shoots, leaves, nuts, berries, fruits, and grains, adding bugs and mollusks and netting or snaring birds, fish, rats, rabbits, and other tuskless small fry to up the protein. And we didn‚Äôt even work hard at it ‚Äî much less hard than peasants slaving in somebody else‚Äôs field after agriculture was invented, much less hard than paid workers since civilization was invented. The average prehistoric person could make a nice living in about a fifteen-hour work week.\n\nFifteen hours a week for subsistence leaves a lot of time for other things. So much time that maybe the restless ones who didn‚Äôt have a baby around to enliven their life, or skill in making or cooking or singing, or very interesting thoughts to think, decided to slope off and hunt mammoths. The skillful hunters would come staggering back with a load of meat, a lot of ivory, and a story. It wasn‚Äôt the meat that made the difference. It was the story.\n\nIt is hard to tell a really gripping tale of how I wrestled a wild-oat seed from its husk, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then I scratched my gnat bites, and Ool said something funny, and we went to the creek and got a drink and watched newts for a while, and then I found another patch of oats.... No, it does not compare, it cannot compete with how I thrust my spear deep into the titanic hairy flank while Oob, impaled on one huge sweeping tusk, writhed screaming, and blood sprouted everywhere in crimson torrents, and Boob was crushed to jelly when the mammoth fell on him as I shot my unerring arrow straight through eye to brain.\n\nThat story not only has Action, it has a Hero. Heroes are powerful. Before you know it, the men and women in the wild-oat patch and their kids and the skills of makers and the thoughts of the thoughtful and the songs of the singers are all part of it, have all been pressed into service in the tale of the Hero. But it isn‚Äôt their story. It‚Äôs his.\n\nWhen she was planning the book that ended up as _Three Guineas_, Virginia Woolf wrote a heading in her notebook, ‚ÄúGlossary‚Äù; she had thought of reinventing English according to her new plan, in order to tell a different story. One of the entries in this glossary is _heroism_, defined as ‚Äúbotulism.‚Äù And _hero_, in Woolf‚Äôs dictionary, is ‚Äúbottle.‚Äù The hero as bottle, a stringent reevaluation. I now propose the bottle as hero.\n\nNot just the bottle of gin or wine, but bottle in its older sense of container in general, a thing that holds something else.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt got something to put it in, food will escape you ‚Äî even something as uncombative and unresourceful as an oat. You put as many as you can into your stomach while they are handy, that being the primary container; but what about tomorrow morning when you wake up and it‚Äôs cold and raining and wouldn‚Äôt it be good to have just a few handfuls of oats to chew on and give little Oom to make her shut up, but how do you get more than one stomachful and one handful home? So you get up and go to the damned soggy oat patch in the rain, and wouldn‚Äôt it be a good thing if you had something to put Baby Oo Oo in so that you could pick the oats with both hands? A leaf a gourd shell a net a bag a sling a sack a bottle a pot a box a container. A holder. A recipient.\n\n\u003e The first cultural device was probably a recipient.... Many theorizers feel that the earliest cultural inventions must have been a container to hold gathered products and some kind of sling or net carrier.\n\nSo says Elizabeth Fisher in _Women‚Äôs Creation_ (McGraw-Hill, 1975). But no, this cannot be. Where is that wonderful, big, long, hard thing, a bone, I believe, that the Ape Man first bashed somebody in the movie and then, grunting with ecstasy at having achieved the first proper murder, flung up into the sky, and whirling there it became a space ship thrusting its way into the cosmos to fertilize it and produce at the end of the movie a lovely fetus, a boy of course, drifting around the Milky Way without (oddly enough) any womb, any matrix at all? I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt even care. I‚Äôm not telling that story. We‚Äôve heard it, we‚Äôve all heard about all the sticks and spears and swords, the things to bash and poke and hit with, the long, hard things, but we have not heard about the thing to put things in, the container for the thing contained. That is a new story. That is news.\n\nAnd yet old. Before ‚Äî once you think about it, surely long before ‚Äî the weapon, a late, luxurious, superfluous tool; long before the useful knife and ax; right along with the indispensable whacker, grinder, and digger ‚Äî for what‚Äôs the use of digging up a lot of potatoes if you have nothing to lug the ones you can‚Äôt eat home in ‚Äî with or before the tool that forces energy outward, we made the tool that brings energy home. It makes sense to me. I am an adherent of what Fisher calls the Carrier Bag Theory of human evolution.\n\nThis theory not only explains large areas of theoretical obscurity and avoids large areas of theoretical nonsense (inhabited largely by tigers, foxes, and other highly territorial mammals); it also grounds me, personally, in human culture in a way I never felt grounded before. So long as culture was explained as originating from and elaborating upon the use of long, hard objects for sticking, bashing, and killing, I never thought that I had, or wanted, any particular share in it. (‚ÄúWhat Freud mistook for her lack of civilization is woman‚Äôs lack of _loyalty_ to civilization,‚Äù Lillian Smith observed.) The society, the civilization they were talking about, these theoreticians, was evidently theirs; they owned it, they liked it; they were human, fully human, bashing, sticking, thrusting, killing. Wanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but if that‚Äôs what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then evidently I was either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all.\n\nThat‚Äôs right, they said. What you are is a woman. Possibly not human at all, certainly defective. Now be quiet while we go on telling the Story of the Ascent of Man the Hero.\n\nGo on, say I, wandering off towards the wild oats, with Oo Oo in the sling and little Oom carrying the basket. You just go on telling how the mammoth fell on Boob and how Cain fell on Abel and how the bomb fell on Nagasaki and how the burning jelly fell on the villagers and how the missiles will fall on the Evil Empire, and all the other steps in the Ascent of Man.\n\nIf it is a human thing to do to put something you want, because it‚Äôs useful, edible, or beautiful, into a bag, or a basket, or a bit of rolled bark or leaf, or a net woven of your own hair, or what have you, and then take it home with you, home being another, larger kind of pouch or bag, a container for people, and then later on you take it out and eat it or share it or store it up for winter in a solider container or put it in the medicine bundle or the shrine or the museum, the holy place, the area that contains what is sacred, and then next day you probably do much the same again ‚Äî if to do that is human, if that‚Äôs what it takes, then I am a human being after all. Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time.\n\nNot, let it be said at once, an unaggressive or uncombative human being. I am an aging, angry woman laying mightily about me with my handbag, fighting hoodlums off. However I don‚Äôt, nor does anybody else, consider myself heroic for doing so. It‚Äôs just one of those damned things you have to do in order to be able to go on gathering wild oats and telling stories.\n\nIt is the story that makes the difference. It is the story that hid my humanity from me, the story the mammoth hunters told about bashing, thrusting, raping, killing, about the Hero. The wonderful, poisonous story of Botulism. The killer story.\n\nIt sometimes seems that the story is approaching its end. Lest there be no more telling of stories at all, some of us out here in the wild oats, amid the alien corn, think we‚Äôd better start telling another one, which maybe people can go on with when the old one‚Äôs finished. Maybe. The trouble is, we‚Äôve all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. Hence it is with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the untold one, the life story.\n\nIt‚Äôs unfamiliar, it doesn‚Äôt come easily, thoughtlessly, to the lips as the killer story does; but still, ‚Äúuntold‚Äù was an exaggeration. People have been telling the life story for ages, in all sorts of words and ways. Myths of creation and transformation, trickster stories, folktales, jokes, novels....\n\nThe novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story. Of course the Hero has frequently taken it over, that being his imperial nature and uncontrollable impulse, to take everything over and run it while making stern decrees and laws to control his uncontrollable impulse to kill it. So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the arrow or spear, starting _here_ and going straight _there_ and THOK! hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the story isn‚Äôt any good if he isn‚Äôt in it.\n\nI differ with all of this. I would go so far as to say that the natural, proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us.\n\nOne relationship among elements in the novel may well be that of conflict, but the reduction of narrative to conflict is absurd. (I have read a how-to-write manual that said, ‚ÄúA story should be seen as a battle,‚Äù and went on about strategies, attacks, victory, etc.) Conflict, competition, stress, struggle, etc., within the narrative conceived as carrier bag/belly/box/house/medicine bundle, may be seen as necessary elements of a whole which itself cannot be characterized either as conflict or as harmony, since its purpose is neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process.\n\nFinally, it‚Äôs clear that the Hero does not look well in this bag. He needs a stage or a pedestal or a pinnacle. You put him in a bag and he looks like a rabbit, like a potato.\n\nThat is why I like novels: instead of heroes they have people in them.\n\nSo, when I came to write science-fiction novels, I came lugging this great heavy sack of stuff, my carrier bag full of wimps and klutzes, and tiny grains of things smaller than a mustard seed, and intricately woven nets which when laboriously unknotted are seen to contain one blue pebble, an imperturbably functioning chronometer telling the time on another world, and a mouse‚Äôs skull; full of beginnings without ends, of initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and far more tricks than conflicts, far fewer triumphs than snares and delusions; full of space ships that get stuck, missions that fail, and people who don‚Äôt understand. I said it was hard to make a gripping tale of how we wrested the wild oats from their husks, I didn‚Äôt say it was impossible. Who ever said writing a novel was easy?\n\nIf science fiction is the mythology of modern technology, then its myth is tragic. ‚ÄúTechnology,‚Äù or ‚Äúmodern science‚Äù (using the words as they are usually used, in an unexamined shorthand standing for the ‚Äúhard‚Äù sciences and high technology founded upon continuous economic growth), is a heroic undertaking, Herculean, Promethean, conceived as triumph, hence ultimately as tragedy. The fiction embodying this myth will be, and has been, triumphant (Man conquers earth, space, aliens, death, the future, etc.) and tragic (apocalypse, holocaust, then or now).\n\nIf, however, one avoids the linear, progressive, Time‚Äôs-(killing)-arrow mode of the Techno-Heroic, and redefines technology and science as primarily cultural carrier bag rather than weapon of domination, one pleasant side effect is that science fiction can be seen as a far less rigid, narrow field, not necessarily Promethean or apocalyptic at all, and in fact less a mythological genre than a realistic one.\n\nIt is a strange realism, but it is a strange reality.\n\nScience fiction properly conceived, like all serious fiction, however funny, is a way of trying to describe what is in fact going on, what people actually do and feel, how people relate to everything else in this vast stack, this belly of the universe, this womb of things to be and tomb of things that were, this unending story. In it, as in all fiction, there is room enough to keep even Man where he belongs, in his place in the scheme of things; there is time enough to gather plenty of wild oats and sow them too, and sing to little Oom, and listen to Ool‚Äôs joke, and watch newts, and still the story isn‚Äôt over. Still there are seeds to be gathered, and room in the bag of stars.\n\n\n---\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.263165694Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Cognitive-Dissonance":{"title":"Cognitive Dissonance","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.263165694Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Columnist":{"title":"Columnist","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.263165694Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Confirmation-Bias":{"title":"Confirmation Bias","content":"\n[[Everything You Know Is Wrong]]\n[[We believe what we want to believe]]","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.263165694Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Consumerism":{"title":"Consumerism","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.263165694Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Core-Tenets":{"title":"Core Tenets - Mental Health","content":"\n1.

But mostly people who aren't in distress currently\n\u003eand people who dissociate/zone out a lot, and over-workers. \n \nYou know when you've worked your ass off and you achieve something? Before you can even appreciate yourself for it, you're onto the next task, the next goal, the next destination. \n\nWe've all heard \"It's the journey, not the destination\". It's one of those aphorisms I scoff at. _But it is true._\nDestination mindset can be because of the kind of world we live in, hyper-competitive, #hustle and sigma grindset world. It can also be the result of a childhood where you had to constantly prove your worth, a childhood where perfectionism was not just a mere coping mechanism, but a survival mechanism. High expectations, parents you can never please, all that jazz. You didn't and don't deserve that though. You deserve to take a break. Taking a break does not make you lazy. [[Laziness|You Are Not Lazy]]. \n\nI digress, but let's come back to the topic on hand. ***Destination Mindset***. Talking and writing about this makes me feel like one of those lifestyle bloggers, ones who write about zen or whatever word is fancy. \"Mindfulness\" sounds like one of those terms too, and it quite honestly is. It's one of the hottest words right now. \n\n  \u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/3045_RC01/embed_loader.js\"\u003e\n  \u003c/script\u003e\n  \n  \u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\"\u003e\n    trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(\"TIMESERIES\", {\"comparisonItem\":[{\"keyword\":\"mindfulness\",\"geo\":\"\",\"time\":\"2004-01-01 2022-07-30\"}],\"category\":0,\"property\":\"\"}, {\"exploreQuery\":\"date=all\u0026q=mindfulness\",\"guestPath\":\"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/\"});\n  \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003csmall\u003e Interest over time for 'mindfulness' (Google Trends, 2004 - July 2022) \u003c/small\u003e\n\nWant to sell something? Slap on \"mindfulness\" for extra points. \n\nBut no, when I talk to mindfulness, I'm usually referring to the Marsha Linehan's version, which is heavily borrowed from Buddhism among other things. In short, it is a core component of DBT and it means to bring your mind back to the present moment. And not judge your thoughts. \n\nSounds simple, right? Like, pfft, EVERYONE knows that! Everyone does, they do understand the concept but to foster the habit, to cultivate mindfulness? That's hard. I have ADHD, I dissociate A LOT, and a whole lot of other fun stuff. Meditation makes me feel worse for some reason. It wasn't easy for me to get started on this journey of mindfulness, and I've barely even started the journey. But I do promise that mindfulness helps. One of the reasons it took me so long was the internal resistance. I thought the concept was stupid, that it's just one of those things that people say. \"Oh, have you tried yoga?\" or \"Oh, you should get out more I think\". \n\nDestination Mindset is the constant focus on getting somewhere and forgetting to appreciate where we are. It's completely natural. The system \"awards\" constant effort, no breaks, etc. It reinforces it every single time. But no, the journey is as important as the destination. Probably more. Take a moment to celebrate yourself. (Ugh I feel like one of those fake, shallow lifestyle bloggers again, gross.)\n\n\nThis ties in with another important part of DBT, gratitude. Gratitude is hard when you're in a shitty place. It's almost impossible. But when you are in a relatively okay place, you should definitely start practicing gratitude. You don't even have to maintain a fancy gratitude journal. Just try to enjoy the coffee you're sipping. When was the last time you took the time out and enjoyed a meal? Half the times, I don't know what I'm eating. It's like things happen, but they don't register in my head. \n\nFuck what it ought to be, what it can be, what it should have been; fuck the destination. Wherever you go, there you are. And you have the right to stop and sniff the flowers. Will you enjoy it? Maybe. Maybe not. But don't deprive yourself of the opportunity and most importantly, DON'T BE HARSH ON YOURSELF IF YOU CAN'T ENJOY SIMPLE THINGS BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU'RE IN. It's natural. Asking someone to be thankful for their coffee when the world is on fire sounds stupid, and it is stupid. But be kind to yourself, and try to be more present, more in the moment.","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Digital-Gardens":{"title":"Digital Gardens","content":"\n\nMeowwww test test\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Dissociation":{"title":"Dissociation","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Distortions":{"title":"Cognitive Distortions","content":"\n\nThere are more distortions than I can possibly cover in one post, but I did my best to highlight the most common ones.

Again, reminder that these thought patterns probably evolved as a response to trauma, so please be kind to yourself.\n\n\n### Types of Cognitive Distortions\nAll-or-Nothing Thinking: You see things in black and white categories. If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.\nOver Generalization: You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.\n\nMental Filter: You pick out a single negative detail and dwePell on it exclusively so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that discolors the entire beaker of water.\n\nDisqualifying the Positive: You reject positive experiences by insisting they \"don't count\" for some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your everyday experiences.\n\nJumping to Conclusion: You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support you conclusions.\nMind Reading: You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you, and you don't bother to check this out.\n\nThe Fortune Teller Error: You anticipate that things will turn out badly, and you feel convinced that your prediction is an established fact.\nMagnification (catastrophizing) or Minimization: You exaggerate the importance of things, or you inappropriately shrink things until the appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or the other fellow's imperfections).\n\nEmotional Reasoning: You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: \"I feel it, therefore it must be true\".\n\nShould Statements: You try to motivate yourself with should and shouldn't, as if you\nhad to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything. \n\"Musts\" and \"oughts\" are also offenders. The emotional consequences is guilt. When you direct should statements toward others you feel anger, frustration, and resentment.\n\nLabeling and Mislabeling: This is an extreme form of over generalization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: \"I‚Äôm a loser\". When someone else's behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to them.\n\nPersonalization: You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event which in fact you were not primarily responsible for.","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Everything-You-Know-Is-Wrong":{"title":"Everything You Know Is Wrong","content":"\n\nThings that'll shake your beliefs\nvvv existential \nwill make you rethink a lot of things\n\n#blog\n\nexamples/content - \na.

I'll be the first one to defend the Internet, defend the myriad uses, and first one to criticize \"salty boomers\" whose claims are substantiated with zero evidence and only backed by the dreaded *\"back in my days\"*. \n\nThe Internet is great. I have an entire website dedicated to how amazing the Internet is. I'm an archivist and a wannabe Internet Historian.

LOC basically is how you view control over your own life. People either have an internal LOC where they believe they have the power to control thier own lives, or an external LOC where you believe everything in life comes from a source other than yourself (I got fired because my boss hates me, I was late because traffic...etc.). Now, what's interesting is that studies have shown people with an internal LOC find greater satisfaction and success in almost every aspect of life.....except one......being in a nursing home. Drives internal LOC people CRAZY while external LOC people thrive\n\n**When something goes wrong, it‚Äôs natural to cast blame on the perceived cause of the misfortune. Where an individual casts that blame can be related, in many cases, to a psychological construct known as ‚Äúlocus of control.‚Äù**\n\nJulian B. Rotter developed the locus of control concept in 1954, and it continues to play an important role in personality studies. In 1966, Rotter created a 13-item forced-choice scale in order to measure locus of control\n\n\nMost people have either an internal or external [locus of control.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ulterior-motives/201402/control-and-health) Those with an internal locus of control believe that their actions matter, and they are the authors of their own destiny. Those with an external locus of control attribute outcomes to circumstances or chance.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Laziness":{"title":"You Are Not Lazy","content":"\n## You Are Not Lazy \n\nIf you have chronic illness, disability, or just feel super tired and you've been made to feel guilty, this is for you. YOU ARE NOT LAZY. \n\nDifferent tasks need different amount of energy, right? And different people need different amounts of energy for the same task. Sounds like such a fundamentally simple concept but people don't seem to recognize this. \n\nAnd for a lot of us, the amount of mental work we constantly do is enough to tire us out. This can look like laziness to others, but it is not. \n\n### What about stuff like \"[[Secondary Gain]]\"?\nTo those who aren't familiar with the term, it basically means that people who are in a bad place, disabled, injured, or whatever, they might have less incentive to get better because of the sympathy, attention, and other ‚ú®amazing benefits‚ú®they get. This might be true, but it is not always the case. In my experience, it's often not the case at all! Just go online and look at the number of people who are invalidating themselves (not their fault) and thinking they're faking their illness. Impostor syndrome in mental illness and sufferring too. \"Maybe I'm just being extra?\" \"Maybe I did all of this for attention?\" \n\nAnd even if it is true, what use is it if it causes more harm than good? People who are already traumatized go harder on themselves because of ableist bullshit like this. \n\nAre you saying that I enjoy the \"attention\" I get by not doing my work? You're right. As much as I enjoy having anxiety attacks, crying, and panicking over the same unfinished work. It's easier to do the work than go through this hell. It is easier to go through shit and get it done than faking an illness, having breakdowns, and being hyper-aware of the consequences of my actions. Why don't I just do it then? Definitely not because there's a road block in my head. It's because I'm lazy AND I enjoy this, duh!\n\nRead also [[Spoon Theory]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Libre":{"title":"Libre","content":"\nsee also: [[Open Source]]","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Linehan":{"title":"Marsha Linehan","content":"\n\nMarsha Linehan - Author of DBT \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Marketing":{"title":"Marketing","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/McFeely":{"title":"McFeely","content":"\nIt's nearly 5 AM, so I will aim for neither eloquence or style. I don't quite remember when I found out about Mr Rogers, quite possibly two years ago, or maybe more. Time seems to be a weird concept, doubly when you're in the middle of what seems to be a ceaseless pandemic.\n\nI was up, reading statistics and news about the virus (would definitely not recommend that. Wasn't my first time, won't be my last). Nothing soothes my anxiety like some freshly baked numbers and research articles that affirm your worst fears. **I hate that I do this despite knowing well about my anxiety, but that's the nature of anxiety; pervasive and enduring, playing both the firestarter and the forest fire that burns down the woods of my sanity. I need to seek information to make sure I'm prepared, but that very information causes more anxiety**\n\nI digress, but trying to get back to the topic of today's ramblings - Mr Rogers. I get distressed A LOT. Sometimes, very few times,(times when I'm not numb because of the bottling up, or the times when I'm not rolled into a tear-spewing ball) I look at work by Mr Rogers. And boy does it help!\n\nFor those of you who aren't familiar with him - He's probably the nicest well-known person to ever exist. He quells the fiery rage in me, soothes the child in me, and reminds me of the importance of kindness. Cheesy, I know.\n\nMr Rogers was a TV show host. A kids' TV show host at that. \n\n\"Pfft, why aren't you over a kids' TV show host, you're 21!\" \n\nWell... because he wasn't just any TV show host, he was this Presbyterian minister who didn't like what was displayed on kids television shows, so he went out to change that.\n\n\"Umm. Isn't shitting on religious conservatives who are offended by innocuous things YOUR THING? Basically, your favourite hobby?\"\na) That isn't my favourite hobby, that's my second favourite one. \nb) Shame on you for jumping to conclusions and thinking that Christian minister = conservative, and for discarding his ideas just because of his beliefs.\n\n\"But, I'm just reading what you wrote! I'm one of your voice-\"\n\nAnyway, with all the distractions now gone, let's get back. **Fred Rogers**. A man who wanted to do something to change how kids' programmes were violent, mindless, and provided no value. My initial knee-jerk reaction to this was \"OMG, don't kill the fun!\", but then I saw the things he accomplished. Most notably, Mr Rogers' Neighborhood. Imagine the coziest, fluffiest, warmest thing you can. That's Mr Rogers' Neighbourhood.\n\nI can't do it justice, so I'll simply direct you to https://www.misterrogers.org/our-television-neighbor/.\n\nAnd for the lazy ones, here's an excerpt that does more justice than I did, but still not enough justice - _Over more than 30 years Mister Rogers created a relationship with millions of children, each of whom felt like they were visiting with a trusted friend. Mister Rogers looked directly into the camera and sang and talked to each child watching. His radical kindness, acceptance, and empathy created a place that as TV Guide described: ‚Äú **makes us, young and old alike, feel safe, cared for and valued‚Ä¶ Wherever Mister Rogers is, so is sanctuary.**‚Äù\n\nWow, so I can't believe I just spent the entire time JUST trying to introduce Mister Rogers and still butchering it.\n\nBut anyway, I _adore_ Mr Rogers. I've never been the kind of person to have a role model. (Don't put people on a pedestal, right?) I never really found anyone who was amazing enough to be role model material, you know? But Mr Rogers? Him I can confidently call my role model.\n\nWhy did his work resonate so much with me? Because... Our beliefs were aligned! When I was around 15, I was struck by what I called an epiphany but now call common sense. I came to the (not so) startling conclusion that most \"bad behaviour\", as I termed it then, could be traced back to a bad childhood. I postulated that most crimes happen because of fucked up childhoods. Of course, it is more nuanced than that, but it really does hold true to a certain extent. Childhood shapes us. It's the most important part of our lives, but I feel like we don't give it enough importance. Kids will be kids. No! They'll grow up to be ill-functioning caffeine-addicted adults someday!\n\nMr Rogers understood this. He understood the importance of love and empathy. Of kindness. Of self-acceptance. On his show, he made sure that everyone felt like they had a friend. He extended love.\n\nBut that's not it. It wasn't just the fact that I shared his view, or the general altruistic feel-goodness that made me connect with Mister Rogers. It was something more personal. He told me things I've always wanted to hear. It might sound weird to picture a grown-ass adult crying at Mr Rogers singing \"It's you I like\", but I found out I wasn't the only one. I introduced it to my then-partner and they did the same. Both of us had a fragmented childhood and it just hit us right in the feels. Do yourself a favour and listen to it. https://misterrogers.org/videos/its-you-i-like/\n\nLook at the lyrics and tell me you didn't feel a thing -\n\nIt's you I like, It's not the things you wear, It's not the way you do your hair-- But it's you I like. The way you are right now, The way down deep inside you-- Not the things that hide you, Not your toys-- They're just beside you.\n\nBut it's you I like-- Every part of you, Your skin, your eyes, your feelings Whether old or new. I hope that you'll remember Even when you're feeling blue That it's you I like, It's you yourself, It's you, it's you I like.\n\n(It's okay if the lyrics didn't do anything to you, Mister Rogers loves you regardless)\n\nMr Rogers was the father I never had. The friend I never had. But the one all of us need, especially in these bleak times. His show wasn't just some silly show, the little details that make up the show are just so beautiful; I urge you to explore.\n\nHe covered serious issues. From divorce to death and everything in between, Mister Rogers talked about, gently. In a way that a child can understand. He helped them process their feelings. ‚ÄúWhatever is mentionable can be more manageable.‚Äù Mr Rogers normalised so many things and made help more accessible.\n\n\"He understood that new experiences or changes in routine can feel overwhelming and scary to young children. He showed us what to expect. He reassured us. He prepared us to meet and trust the people who would care for us ‚Äì the doctor, the dentist, the barber, the teacher.\" He'd cover things most people would deem mundane, things most networks would take a hard pass on.\n\nHe treated children with respect and saw them as equals; he didn't patronise them. He actually listened.\n\nThe best part? The lessons he taught aren't exclusively for children. A lot of us could use them too. They're cathartic, trust me.\n\nI have a large collection of Mister Rogers quotes, but I'll leave you with these.\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúEveryone longs to be loved. And the greatest thing we can do is to let people know that they are loved and capable of loving.‚Äù\n\n\u003e \"Imagine what our real neighborhoods would be like if each of us offered, as a matter of course, just one kind word to another person.\"\n\n**I never thought I'd quote Tommy Wiseau in a post about Fred Rogers, but - \"If a lot of people love each other, the world would be a better place to live.\"** True Tommy, I'm with you on that. If only everyone were more true to their feelings. But maybe we'll get there!\nI'll wind up this needlessly lengthy post that didn't manage to capture an ounce of the legacy that Mr Rogers has left with a quote that I really love and find comforting.\n\n\u003e _‚Äú**When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, ‚ÄúLook for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.‚Äù**_\n\nLook for the helpers. Not to be dramatic, but this phrase sorta reignited my faith in humanity, kinda helped me view everything a bit differently, you know?\n\nThank you, Fred McFeely Rogers. Thank you for reminding me of the oath I took as a kid. To spread love, respect, and happiness no matter what. I have faltered, I have gone astray, but I am giving it my best.","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Money-is-the-root":{"title":"Money is the root","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Mood-Thought-Diary":{"title":"Mood Thought Diary","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/ObjectConstancy":{"title":"Object Constancy","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Occams-Razor":{"title":"Occam's Razor","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Ontological-Parasite":{"title":"Ontological Parasite","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Open-Source":{"title":"Open Source","content":"\nsee also : [[Libre]]","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Perceived-threat":{"title":"Perceived threat","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Philosophies":{"title":"Philosophies and Concepts That Have Changed My Life","content":"\n\n- [[Libre]] - *Free as in Freedom* \n- [[Digital Gardens]]\n- [[mindfulness]] \n- [[feminism]] and [[intersectionalism]]\n- \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Poes-Law":{"title":"Poe's Law","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Prenatal":{"title":"Prenatal","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Quotes":{"title":"Quotes","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Rehabilitation":{"title":"Rehabilitation over Punishment","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.267165998Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/Research-Methodologies":{"title":"Research Methodologies","content":"\n==using known information to find unknown\nnew information==\n\n- is scientific\n- any branch of knowledge\n- rational\n- based on facts, rooted in reality \n\n\n\n\n- \"systemized way to gain new information\" - \n- \"movement from known to unknown\"\n- problem to conclusion\n\n## Definition\n*Comprises of defining, redefining*\n*manipulation of situation, control the env/variables*\n\n## Variables and \n\n## Objective of Research / Motivation\n1.

Basprin? Oh yeah! Asprin!  \nWhich I paid about a buck for down at the local drugstore.\n\nThe debate briefly abates as my hosts collect plates  \nBut as they return with desserts Storm pertly asserts:  \n\"Shakespeare said it first:  \nThere are more things in heaven and  \nEarth than exist in your philosophy.  \nScience is just how we're trained to look at reality,  \nIt doesn't explain love or spirituality.  \nHow does science explain psychics?

Over time, this practice‚Äîeven if you only engage in it occasionally‚Äîcan help you change your relationship with food to one that is more present-centered, satisfying, and healthier.\" \n\n**Mini-Mindfulness Practices**\n\nAlthough multitasking may be unavoidable at times, the daily experience of pressure to ‚Äúget things done‚Äù unconsciously ensnares many people in its gravitational pull. Multitasking frequently becomes standard operating procedure, even when it isn‚Äôt necessary.\n\n1.  Strive to minimize multitasking and do one thing at a time; be present with the task at hand, giving it your undiluted [attention](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention \"Psychology Today looks at attention\").\n2.  Do it deliberately and without rushing‚Äîeven (and perhaps especially) if you feel pressure‚Äîexternal or internal‚Äîto do so. As John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach, regularly instructed his players, ‚ÄúBe quick, but don‚Äôt hurry.‚Äù\n3.  Do it to completion.\n4.  space‚Äîeven a brief pause‚Äîbetween the activities in which you engage rather than going directly from one task to the next.\n5.  yourself permission to do less than what you may have planned or what your thinking says you ‚Äúshould do‚Äù or ‚Äúhave to do.‚Äù\n6.  Each time you scroll through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or other social media platforms, pause on a random name (be it someone you know or not) and take a moment to wish that person well‚Äîperhaps literally saying to yourself: __________, may you be well. May you be at peace.\n7.  As you wake up from sleep, take a moment while [lying](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/deception \"Psychology Today looks at lying\") in bed with your eyes open and express appreciation for the gift of waking up to another day. Not everyone receives this gift.\n8.  When you first step outside in the morning, take a few seconds to observe‚Äîwithout judgment‚Äîthe sights and sounds of your neighborhood.\n9.  When you approach a window in your home or office, take a few moments to pause, look through it, and really notice what you see.\n\n**Mindful Eating**\n\nMany people, both in and out of recovery, eat emotionally‚Äîthat is, they eat in response to stress or emotional discomfort ([anxiety](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety \"Psychology Today looks at anxiety\"), [fear](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear \"Psychology Today looks at fear\"), [loneliness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/loneliness \"Psychology Today looks at loneliness\"), [boredom](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/boredom \"Psychology Today looks at boredom\"), [anger](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger \"Psychology Today looks at anger\"), or sadness). Sometimes, this is also an attempt to fill a sense of internal emptiness. When people behave this way, they eat without thinking about what or why they‚Äôre eating; they may not even taste the food, which they chew quickly and incompletely. Have you ever finished eating something only to realize you don‚Äôt know how it tasted?\n\nMindful eating is the antithesis of [stressed](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress \"Psychology Today looks at stressed\") or [emotional eating](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/appetite \"Psychology Today looks at emotional eating\") and the antidote for it. Mindful eating means paying conscious attention to the experience of eating using all the senses. It emphasizes the awareness of taste, as well as colors, textures, smells, and sounds, during the process of eating. For instance, when mindfully eating an apple, you might notice the color, feel how smooth it is, take in its fragrance, listen to what it sounds like when you bite into it, and taste it fully, one bite at a time.\n\n1.  Before you eat, bring your awareness to the activity. Are you actually hungry and need nourishment in preparation for some activity, or are you eating out of some sort of emotional dis-ease?\n2.  As much as possible, try to eat before you get to the point of being extremely hungry.\n3.  Take two or three deep breaths to relax and connect your mind with your body.\n4.  Appreciate the food you‚Äôre getting ready to eat.\n5.  Consider what it took to get that food from its origins to your table.\n6.  As you eat, notice the aroma(s), texture(s), and color(s) of your food.\n7.  Take one bite at a time, tasting it fully.\n8.  Chew your food carefully, savoring it.\n9.  Swallow it slowly.\n10.  Wait until you‚Äôve completely swallowed one bite of your food before taking the next one.\n11.  Pause briefly and take an intentional breath‚Äîin and out‚Äîbetween swallowing and taking that next bite.\n12.  As you eat, remind yourself to breathe.\n13.  Pay attention to when you feel satisfied or beginto feel ‚Äúfull.‚Äù\n14.  Stop eating when you reach this point, rather than continuing to eat until you feel ‚Äústuffed‚Äù and uncomfortable.\n15.  If there is food left, store it for another time.\n16.  Notice how you feel when you are finished eating.\n\nBy making the experience of taking food and drink into the body much more conscious, eating mindfully slows the process of ingesting, tasting, chewing, and swallowing. The intent is to pay close and careful attention to the sensory aspects of your food and the process of eating and to eat deliberately rather than unconsciously shoveling food into your face. The result is that you will eat more slowly, taste your food more thoroughly, chew your food more completely, and swallow it more patiently.\n\nAll of this contributes to healthier digestion. Over time, this practice‚Äîeven if you only engage in it occasionally‚Äîcan help you change your relationship with food to one that is more present-centered, satisfying, and healthier.\n\nCopyright 2019 Dan Mager, MSW \n[[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/some-assembly-required/201904/mindfulness-is-much-more-meditation]]\n\n---\n\nMindfulness is a state of active, open [attention](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/attention \"Psychology Today looks at attention\") to the present. This state is described as observing one‚Äôs thoughts and feelings without judging them as good or bad.\n\nThe emergence of mindfulness in Western culture can be attributed to Jon Kabat-Zinn. Kabat-Zinn studied mindfulness under several Buddhist teachers, such as Philip Kapleau and Thich Nhat Hanh. As a professor at the University of Massachusetts medical school in the late 1970s, Kabat-Zinn developed a program called Mindfulness-Based [Stress](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/stress \"Psychology Today looks at Stress\") Reduction (MBSR) to treat [chronic pain](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/chronic-pain \"Psychology Today looks at chronic pain\"). He discovered that patients would often try to avoid pain‚Äîbut that that avoidance would lead to deeper distress. Practicing mindfulness was a more successful approach.\n\n### What is mindfulness?\n\nMindfulness encompasses two key ingredients: [awareness and acceptance.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/201502/what-is-mindfulness-and-how-does-it-work)\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/mindfulness\n\n\n---\nSpradlin (2003) adapts DBT‚Äôs ‚Äúwhat‚Äù skills of mindfulness to help us begin the journey of practicing mindful awareness: \n### **Observe:**\n\n-   Start to simply _notice_ your environment, thoughts, feelings, and sensations without _reacting_ to them\n-   Observe the emotion you are feeling or the thought you are having\n-   Simply see it there before you, without adding anything to it, judging it, or trying to change it\n-   Avoid reacting to your emotions ‚Äì say to yourself,‚ÄùI notice that I feel love/anger/joy‚Äù\n-   Allow your thoughts, feelings, and sensations to come and go (as they all _do_) ‚Äì control your _attention_, not _what_ you see\n-   Push nothing away (no matter how uncomfortable/painful) and cling to nothing (no matter how enjoyable/pleasant)\n-   Be _alert_ to all that enters your experience ‚Äì every thought, feeling, and sensation\n-   Pay close attention to the input you receive from all 5 senses: sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste\n\n### **Describe:**\n\n-   Now that you have observed, use _words_ to practice describing your internal experience\n-   Stay descriptive and simple\n-   If you have been taught to ignore/belittle emotions, it can be difficult to be attentive and mindful to your experience\n-   If you have difficulty, or if this feels unnatural, simply say to yourself, ‚ÄúI notice that I‚Äôm feeling self-conscious right now‚Äù\n-   If you‚Äôre feeling frustrated or anxious, say to yourself, ‚ÄúI notice how my thoughts are coming very quickly right now‚Äù\n\n### **Participate:**\n\n-   With practice, mindfulness will allow you to more fully _participate_ in your own life and experiences\n-   Mindfulness will allow you to _fully engage_ in every experience without needing to ‚Äúlove‚Äù or ‚Äúhate‚Äù it\n-   Practice simply participating in each moment as it comes ‚Äì _be here now_\n-   If you need to make plans for the future, then _fully participate_ in making those plans\n-   Allow yourself to be a part of what is happening without obsessing over every detail or becoming self-conscious\n-   Practice _letting go_ of thoughts like ‚ÄúHow am I doing?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow do I look?‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.mindfulnessmuse.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy/dbts-what-skills-of-mindfulness\n\n\n--- \n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.271166303Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/misterrogers":{"title":"misterrogers","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.271166303Z","tags":null},"/private/.notes/tim-minchin":{"title":"tim minchin","content":"\n[[Storm - Tim Minchin]]","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.271166303Z","tags":null},"/private/config/1-yaml":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\ntitle: \"\u003c% tp.file.title %\u003e\"\ndate: \u003c% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\") %\u003e\n\u003c%* \nvar yaml = '';\n\nvar tArr = tp.file.tags;\n\ntArr.sort();\n\nvar tStr = tArr.join(', ').replace(/#/g,'');\n\nif (tStr.length) {\nyaml = '\\ntags: [' + tStr + ']\\n\\n';\n}\n%\u003e\u003c%* tR += yaml %\u003e\n---","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.271166303Z","tags":null},"/private/config/date":{"title":"date","content":"\u003c% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\") %\u003e\n\n ","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.271166303Z","tags":null},"/private/config/psychexperiment":{"title":"\u003c% tp.file.title %\u003e","content":"\n## Aim \n\n## Plan\n\n## Procedure\n\n## Materials \n\n## Interpretation\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Precautions\n\n## Individual Discussion\n\n## Group Discussion\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## Application Value","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.271166303Z","tags":null},"/private/config/tags":{"title":"tags","content":"\n\u003c%* \nvar yaml = '';\n\nvar tArr = tp.file.tags;\n\ntArr.sort();\n\nvar tStr = tArr.join(', ').replace(/#/g,'');\n\nif (tStr.length) {\n\nyaml = '---\\ntags: [' + tStr + ']\\n---\\n';\n}\n%\u003e\u003c%* tR += yaml %\u003e\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T22:25:44.271166303Z","tags":null},"/private/config/templates-and-shiz":{"title":"Templates and shiz","content":"\n## CSS\n\n\n```css\ndiv.mermaid {\n    text-align: center;\n}\n```\n\n```css\n/*============bigger link popup preview  ================*/\n.popover.hover-popover {\n    position: absolute;\n    z-index: var(--layer-popover);\n    transform: scale(0.9);
