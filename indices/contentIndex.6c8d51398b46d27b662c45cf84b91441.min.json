Says its catholics' duty to follow whatever the priests and bishops say without questioning; even if they are opposed to the Irish cause. Says she will defend her religion against \"renegade catholics\" \n\nMr Casey tells a story - how an old Catholic woman talked ill about Parnell and the woman he cheated with. Mr Casey upon hearing their names bemirched, on hearing the words she used, spits his tobacco juice on her face. The men laugh. Dante is infuriated, calls Mr Casey a blasphemer, and repeatedly says \"may they devil be on you\"\n\n**Secularists vs Orthodox**\n\n**Back to school**\nWe see how the kids are flogged in Catholic school. Dedalus gets flogged because Father Dolan thinks he's being an \"idle loafer\" who isn't working though he can't work due to his glasses being broken. He goes and tells the rector about what Father Dolan did. His classmates hoist him over their heads and celebrate him as a hero.\n\nThough this happens, Dedalus still feels alone once the wave is gone. He realizes that being a hero will not reduce his \"outsider\"ness or end his loneliness. After meeting the rector, he goes home to get a new pair of glasses. \n\nThe Dedaluses become bankrupt, have to move, and their properties are auctioned off. Stephen and Simon attend it.

And he has impure thoughts. He is asked to not \"offend God again\"  and give up the wretched sin. Pray to Mother Mary when the temptations come. \n\nCalling of God.

How women have been historically excluded from things men easily have access to. \n\n# Characters\n## Mary Beton \nNarrator\n## Mary Seton \nMrs Beton's friend\n## Judith Shakespeare \nFictional sister of Shakespeare\n## Mary Carmichael\nfictional writer whose book is found in the library; narrator finds many faults in the book \n\n## Real people referenced \nWilliam Shakespeare\n**Jane Austen**, **George Eliot**, and the **Brontë sisters**\n**Lady Winchilsea**\nMargaret Cavendish\n**Aphra Behn**\n\n\n# Summary \n\nIntellectual freedom depends on material things\nPoetry depends upon intellectual freedom\nAnd woman always have been poor, not for 200 years but from the beginning of time. ***Women have not had a dog's chance of writing poetry. This is why I am laid so much focus on money and a room of one's own***. \n\n### Chapter 1 - Oxbridge and interruptions\nThe narrator, a fictionalized version of Woolf: \nvisits **Oxbridge College**  \nNarrator had to present on \"Women and Fiction\"\nreflects on the different opportunities and privileges that men and women have in education and society, is walking on grass when she is interrupted by a Beadle [^1] \nwho says she is not allowed there; reserved only for fellows and scholars\n\n***Fish metaphor*** - She says that ideas are like fishes, she drops her thoughts (fishing line) to catch a fish but is **interrupted**, losing her thought\n\njust as she seems to be on the verge of an insight, her thinking is cut off—usually by an authority figure trying to keep her in her place\n\nDejected, goes to library. Not let in unless accompanied by a male. \nAte at cafeteria, food was amazeballs unlike the one at Fernham. Compares both. \n\nsays **ideas** are not like how we think of them, the sudden glow of a light bulb, but **a result of \"rational intercourse\"––intellectual exchange––that takes place in settings such as the college. Where women are either not allowed or restricted**\n\n[^1]: a university security guard\n\n---\n\n### Chapter 2:  London, library\nThe narrator goes to London and visits the British Library. She finds many books written by men about women, but none by women themselves. \nNo books about their daily lives. \nShe wonders what women’s lives were like in history and **invents** the story of **Judith Shakespeare**, a talented sister of William Shakespeare who is oppressed by her family and society and dies by suicide. She shows how women’s genius has been wasted and silenced\n\n---\n\n### Chapter 3: Examining past writers\nThe narrator examines the works of women writers in the nineteenth century, such as **Jane Austen**, **George Eliot**, and the **Brontë sisters**. She praises their achievements despite the difficulties they faced. She analyzes how their gender and social class influenced their style and perspective. She argues that women need to have a room of their own, both literally and figuratively, to write fiction \n\n---\n\n### Chapter 4: Winchilsea, Cavendish, and Behn\nThe narrator continues to explore the legacy of women writers and their relation to tradition. \nShe says that women need to be financially independent but even that doesn't help fully. Says their anger bitters their work. Anger that they are not given the same privileges as men. Anger that they are excluded. \n\n**Lady Winchilsea** was a noblewoman but even her writing did not get respect because it was bitter \n**Margaret Cavendish**, too, failed because of the same reason. \n**Aphra Behn** - one of the first woman writers to have made money. Middle class. All women owe her for paving the way. \n\n**They don't have any access to a \"common sentence,\" that men have access to, the shared rhythm and form that unites male writers in a collective**\n\n---\n\n### Chapter 5: Chloe liked Olivia\nThe narrator reviews a novel by a contemporary woman writer named Mary Carmichael. She criticizes her for not having the rythm of Jane Austen.  Of the author trying hard not to be typecast as \"sentimental\". \n\nMary Carmichael writes **\"Chloe liked Olivia\"** which is monumental - it takes away heteronormativity - says out loud what was only whispered -  huge social leap \n\nShe argues that women need to express their sexuality and emotions to write fiction.\n\n---\n### Chapter 6:  Androgynous \nWoolf concludes her argument by exploring the idea of an androgynous mind that can transcend the limitations of gender and create great works of literature. \n\n**She is inspired by the sight of a man and a woman getting into a taxi together, which symbolizes the harmony and unity of the sexes.** \n\nShe cites Coleridge’s theory that a great mind is both masculine and feminine, and that such a balance is evident in Shakespeare’s genius. \n\nShe contrasts this ideal with the sex-consciousness of her own age, which she blames for the rise of fascism and the decline of literature. \n\nShe criticizes male writers who are obsessed with asserting their virility and female writers who are too bitter or resentful to express themselves freely. \n\nShe urges her audience to avoid thinking of their sex when they write, and to cultivate an incandescent and creative mind that can embrace both male and female aspects. She ends by asking them to earn money and a room of their own, and to write for the common good as well as for themselves\n\n---\n\n## Diving Deeper\n- Begins with a but, asks a question\n- psychological conditions encountered by women writers\n- Hypothesizes about women need:\n  i. Money\n  ii. Room of One's Own\n- analyzes diff bw male and female writers\n- writer highlights men's anger against women affects their artistic production \n\nThe narrator uses Charlotte Bronte to show how extraordinary it is  that Jane Austen was able to triumph over her situation by  accepting it. Bronte by contrast was aware of her misfortune and  never accepted it, and this bitterness came through in her fiction.  \nConsequently she was never able to achieve in the way Austen  achieved\n\n--- \n\n# Questions \n\n1) According to Virginia Woolf, a woman requires a room of her own to write fiction because she needs to have money and freedom from domestic and social obligations. She argues that women have been historically oppressed and deprived of education, property, and artistic expression by a patriarchal society that values men’s work over women’s. She says that women need to have a space where they can think, create, and express themselves without interruption or interference from men or other women. She also says that women need to have a sense of their own history and tradition as writers, and to develop their own voice and style \n\n## Metaphors and Stuff\n(1) Fish metaphor \n(2) \n\n## Quotes\n1. All I could do was to offer you an opinion upon one minor\n   point—a woman must have money and a room of her own if she\n   is to write fiction; and that, as you will see, leaves the great\n   problem of the true nature of woman and the true nature of\n   fiction unsolved\n2. Of the two—the vote and the money—the money, I own, seemed infinitely the more important \n3. All women together ought to let flowers fall upon the tomb \n   of **Aphra Behn**,  for it was she who earned them the\n   right to speak their minds. It is she—shady and amorous as she\n   was—who makes it not quite fantastic for me to say to you tonight: Earn five hundred a year by your wit\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.491656287Z","tags":["english","essay","feminism"]},"/Aaron-T-Beck":{"title":"Aaron T Beck","content":"\n![[images/Aaron T Beck.jpg|100]]\n\n**Aaron T Beck** (July 18, 1921 – November 1, 2021) - influential psychiatrist who is regarded as the **father of cognitive therapy** and **cognitive behavioural therapy**.\n\nDesigned many self report scales, including [[Beck's Depression Inventory]]. \n\n*The key to many psychological difficulties, Dr. Beck has found in 40 years of research and clinical work, lies not deep in the unconscious, but in ''thinking problems'' that are much closer to conscious awareness.*\n\nautomatic thoughts\n\n*Patients in cognitive therapy are encouraged to test their perceptions of themselves and others, as if they were scientists testing hypotheses.*\n\nHis work at the University of Pennsylvania inspired Martin Seligman to refine his own cognitive techniques and later work on **learned helplessness**\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart\nA---\u003eB---\u003eC---\u003eA\nA(The self)\nB(The world or environment)\nC(The future)\n```\n\nBeck's cognitive triad\n\n---\n\nwas inspired by Albert Ellis (founder of REBT)\ninspired Martin Seligman(who proposed and defined **learned helplessness**)\nworked with Maria Kovacs to make a depression scale for children\n\nwas inspired by stoicism","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.491656287Z","tags":["psychology","person","psychologist"]},"/Abiogenesis":{"title":"Abiogenesis","content":"\nthe **natural process by which life arises from non-living matter**, such as simple organic compounds.

They said it should be something suitable to youth--something didactic, instructive, or something in the nature of good advice. Very well. I have a few things in my mind which I have often longed to say for the instruction of the young; for it is in one’s tender early years that such things will best take root and be most enduring and most valuable. First, then. I will say to you my young friends--and I say it beseechingly, urgingly-- \nAlways obey your parents, when they are present. This is the best policy in the long run, because if you don’t, they will make you. Most parents think they know better than you do, and you can generally make more by humoring that superstition than you can by acting on your own better judgment. Be respectful to your superiors, if you have any, also to strangers, and sometimes to others. If a person offend you, and you are in doubt as to whether it was intentional or not, do not resort to extreme measures; simply watch your chance and hit him with a brick. That will be sufficient. If you shall find that he had not intended any offense, come out frankly and confess yourself in the wrong when you struck him; acknowledge it like a man and say you didn’t mean to. Yes, always avoid violence; in this age of charity and kindliness, the time has gone by for such things. Leave dynamite to the low and unrefined. \n\nGo to bed early, get up early--this is wise. Some authorities say get up with the sun; some say get up with one thing, others with another. But a lark is really the best thing to get up with. It gives you a splendid reputation with everybody to \nknow that you get up with the lark; and if you get the right kind of lark, and work at him right, you can easily train him to get up at half past nine, every time--it’s no trick at all. \n\nNow as to the matter of lying. You want to be very careful about lying; otherwise you are nearly sure to get caught. Once caught, you can never again be in the eyes to the good and the pure, what you were before. Many a young person has injured himself permanently through a single clumsy and ill finished lie, the result of carelessness born of incomplete training. Some authorities hold that the young ought not to lie at all. That of course, is putting it rather stronger than necessary; still while I cannot go quite so far as that, I do maintain, and I believe I am right, that the young ought to be temperate in the use of this great art until practice and experience shall give them that confidence, elegance, and precision which alone can make the accomplishment graceful and profitable. Patience, diligence, painstaking attention to detail--these are requirements; these in time, will make the \nstudent perfect; upon these only, may he rely as the sure foundation for future \neminence. \n\nThink what tedious years of study, thought, practice, experience, went to the equipment of that peerless old master who was able to impose upon the whole world the lofty and sounding maxim that “Truth is mighty and will prevail”--the most majestic compound fracture of fact which any of woman born has yet achieved. For the history of our race, and each individual’s experience, are sewn thick with evidences that a truth is not hard to kill, and that a lie well told is immortal. There is in Boston a monument of the man who discovered anesthesia; many people are aware, in these latter days, that that man didn’t discover it at all, but stole the discovery from another man. Is this truth mighty, and will it prevail? \nAh no, my hearers, the monument is made of hardy material, but the lie it tells will outlast it a million years. An awkward, feeble, leaky lie is a thing which you ought to make it your unceasing study to avoid; such a lie as that has no more real permanence than an average truth. Why, you might as well tell the truth at once and be done with it. A feeble, stupid, preposterous lie will not live two years--\nexcept it be a slander upon somebody. It is indestructible, then of course, but that is no merit of yours. A final word: begin your practice of this gracious and beautiful art early--begin now. If I had begun earlier, I could have learned how. \n\nNever handle firearms carelessly. The sorrow and suffering that have been caused through the innocent but heedless handling of firearms by the young! Only four days ago, right in the next farm house to the one where I am spending the summer, a grandmother, old and gray and sweet, one of the loveliest spirits in the land, was sitting at her work, when her young grandson crept in and got down an old, battered, rusty gun which had not been touched for many years and was supposed not to be loaded, and pointed it at her, laughing and threatening to shoot. In her \nfright she ran screaming and pleading toward the door on the other side of the \nroom; but as she passed him he placed the gun almost against her very breast and pulled the trigger! He had supposed it was not loaded. And he was right--it wasn’t. So there wasn’t any harm done. It is the only case of that kind I ever heard of. \nTherefore, just the same, don’t you meddle with old unloaded firearms; they are the most deadly and unerring things that have ever been created by man. You don’t have to take any pains at all with them; you don’t have to have a rest, you don’t have to have any sights on the gun, you don’t have to take aim, even. No, you just pick out a relative and bang away, and you are sure to get him. A youth who can’t hit a cathedral at thirty yards with a Gatling gun in three quarters of an hour, can take up an old empty musket and bag his grandmother every time, at a hundred. \nThink what Waterloo would have been if one of the armies had been boys armed with old muskets supposed not to be loaded, and the other army had been composed of their female relations. The very thought of it make one shudder. \n\nThere are many sorts of books; but good ones are the sort for the young to read. Remember that. They are a great, an inestimable, and unspeakable means of improvement. Therefore be careful in your selection, my young friends; be very careful; confine yourselves exclusively to Robertson’s Sermons, Baxter’s Saint’s Rest, The Innocents Abroad, and works of that kind. \n\nBut I have said enough. I hope you will treasure up the instructions which I have given you, and make them a guide to your feet and a light to your understanding. \nBuild your character thoughtfully and painstakingly upon these precepts, and by and by, when you have got it built, you will be surprised and gratified to see how nicely and sharply it resembles everybody else’s.\n\n\n1. Obedience towards parents \n\tonly when they're watching\n\n2. Being respectful to others\n\tdon't strike immediately, wait for the perfect time\n\n3. Go to bed early, get up early \n\n4. Lying\n\n5.

Based on Needs\na) **Sustained Attention**\n\t it is the ability to pay attention to **only one task** by **consciously concentrating** on that task only for a **long time** enough and by **avoiding all other forms of distractions** or deviations. \u003cu\u003eEg - reading a book, memorizing a chapter or following a classroom lecture.\u003c/u\u003e\n\t\nb) **Selective Attention**: \n\tIn this case, the listener **chooses to pay attention to only a *specific stimulus*** which is present in the environment while **ignoring the other stimuli**. This kind of attention does not depend on the stimulus but depends essentially on the attentive capabilities of an observer. Choosing to focus on a friend's voice (while in a crowd with them)\n\t\nc) **Divided Attention**: \n\tIn case of divided attention, **the user pays attention to two or more *tasks* at the same time** and is also sometimes regarded as \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eMulti-tasking\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e which involves juggling between two or more than two tasks at the same time. Divided attention uses a lot of mental focus; ergo person **may get exhausted very quickly.** Function is impaired. **Split our attention**\n\t\nd) **Alternating Attention**: \n\tThough this attention can be closely related to divided attention, but is different as in case of divided attention we split our attention between two tasks, while in case of alternating attention, **the entire attention is shifted from one task to another** or is done alternately.\n\n### 2.

These statements are often presented in the form of personality assessments, horoscopes, fortune-telling, or other forms of divination.\n\nThe Barnum Effect is named after the famous American showman and circus owner (and a complete exploitative douchebag), P.T. Barnum, who reportedly used these types of statements to convince people that his performances were personalized for them. \n\nThe Barnum Effect can occur because people tend to focus on the parts of the statement that they feel are true about themselves and ignore the parts that do not apply to them. Additionally, people often have a general desire to feel understood and validated, making them more likely to accept statements that seem personalized to them, even if they are not.\n\nThe Barnum Effect has been widely studied and has implications in various fields, including psychology, marketing, and even criminal investigations. It highlights the importance of critical thinking and skepticism when evaluating personality assessments, horoscopes, or other forms of divination that claim to provide personalized insights into an individual's life.","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.491656287Z","tags":["misc","skepticism","psychology","adages","bias"]},"/Basic-Elements-of-Graphic-Design":{"title":"Basic Elements of Graphic Design","content":"\n# Basic Elements of Graphic Design\n\nBasic elements include **line**, **shape**, **form**, **texture**, and **balance**. \n## Line\n- A line is a shape that connects two or more points. \n- Lines appear frequently in design; for example, in drawings and illustrations.

Colour proportion !!!\nDon't use too many colours, too intensely \nStick to fewer hues \ntoo many intense colours = compete for attention, appear in disarray, sore to look at\n\n## 8. Set Palette\n\n# Colour Schemes\n-   **Monochromatic** – Take one hue and create other elements from different shades and tints of it.\n   \n-   **Analogous** – Use three colors located beside one another on the color wheel (e.g., orange, yellow-orange and yellow to show sunlight). A variant is to mix white with these to form a “high-key” analogous color scheme (e.g., flames).    \n\n-   **Complementary** – Use “opposite color” pairs—e.g., blue/yellow—to maximize contrast.\n\n-   **Split-Complementary** (or **Compound Harmony**) – Add colors from either side of your complementary color pair to soften contrast.\n\n-   **Triadic** – Take **three** colors which are **equally distant on the color wheel** (i.e., 120° apart: e.g., red/blue/yellow). These colors may not be vibrant, but the _scheme_ can be as it maintains harmony and high contrast. It’s easier to make visually appealing designs with this than with a complementary scheme.\n   \n-   **Tetradic** – Take **four colors that are two sets of complementary pairs** (e.g., orange/yellow/blue/violet) and choose one dominant color. This allows rich, interesting designs. However, watch the _balance_ between warm and cool colors.\n    \n-   **Square** – A variant of tetradic; you find four colors evenly spaced on the color wheel (i.e., 90° apart). Unlike tetradic, square schemes can work well if you use all four colors evenly.\n\n# RGB vs RYB vs CMYK\n\nRGB - **Additive** colour scheme. Used for screens. EMITS light, so more you add colours, gets brighter. Add all colours, you get white\n\nCMYK - **Subtractive** color palette. Print. Absorbs light. More colour you add, the darker it gets. Add all colours, you get black\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.495656322Z","tags":[]},"/Communication":{"title":"Communication","content":"\nCommunication is a two-way process where information is exchanged or passed from one person to another person. The word is derived from 'communicare' which means to impart.\n\nCommunication usually has a sender, a reciever, a message, a channel, a medium, and feedback.  \n  \nCommunication has various functions. Some important ones are -  \na) Educate - Communication can be used to help educate people, teach them new concepts and ideas.\n\nb) Inform - Communication can be used to alert people, to inform them of events, news, etc. For e.g. - There's a car crash. The onlookers call the ambulance and inform what has happened.\n\nc) Clear Misconceptions - Communication can be used to clear misconceptions, most of which arise due to improper communication or a total lack of it.  \nd) Spread Awareness - Can be used to spread awareness and make sure people know current happenings. For e.g. - Government spreading awareness of  the benefits of vaccination\n\ne) Persuade - Can be used to persuade people to do or not do something. It helps make take action.\n\nf) Propagate\n\nj) Create opinion - Communication can raise questions and generate opinion and discourse on various topics.\n\nh) Exchange views - Communication can be used to exchange views, ideas, and have discourses.\n\nBarriers of communication are obstacles that do not let us communicate effectively, they hamper our ability to exchange information. There are many types of barriers of communication.\n\n-   Physical Barriers -  Just like the name suggests, these barriers are physical in nature. They can be as simple as a wall seperating two people to barriers due to distance\n-   Psychological Barriers - Barriers that arise due to our cognition, or mental states. They include our emotions, moods, opinions, attitude, attention, etc. For eg- When someone is angry, they might interpret others' behaviour in a negative tone.\n-   Semantic Barriers - These are barriers that arise due to use of language. Words being misunderstood or misconstrued, figures of speech interpreted wrongly, and homophones/homonyms, can all be causes of this barrier.\n-   Environmental Barriers\n-   Linguistic Barriers - Barriers that arise due to difference in languages, or due to the lack of ability of being able to understand a different language. This can lead to everything from no communication to miscommunication (mistranslation).\n-   Cultural Differences - All cultures are different. What is considered to be \"proper\" in a culture might be considered \"improper\" in a different one. Also, culture dictates a large part of our life. Therefore, differences in culture can act as barriers.","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.495656322Z","tags":["social","communication","journalism"]},"/Components-of-IAM":{"title":"Components of IAM","content":"\n# What is IAM?\n**Identity Access Management** \n\nto control access of individual and group access \na combination of policies \nidentifying people and allocating resources\n\n# Components of IAM \n1.

The city is known for the famous Temple of Lord Jagannath. It is among the four Dhams or religious centres of India. The use of irony, contrast and comparison add effectiveness to the description. He\ndescribes the hollowness of the sacred rites and rituals. .\n\nhis poems, he deals with the problems of human suffering resulting in forms of hunger, starvation and poverty. \n\nThe poem, Dawn at Puri consists of eighteen lines, divided into six stanzas. Each stanza therefore has three lines. In these lines poet gives a picture of suffering and sorrow of which there seems to be no respite. \n\nThe poem begins with the description of cremation ground. It is the ‘Gateway to Heaven’ or ‘Swargdwar’.\n\n‘Endless crow noises’ is a suggestive image of the cremation ground.\nThe continuous noise made due to the cawing of the crows indicates the\npresence of dead body. \n\nthere he finds a ‘skull’ lying on the sand. The images of ‘crow’ and ‘skull’\ncreate a perfect atmosphere of cremation ground. \nskull also signifies poverty, hunger \nThe image of ‘skull in the holy sands’ = irony; opposite contrasting images. \n\nWhite-clad widowed Women past the centres of their lives are badly treated and disrespected. \nAfter the death of their husbands they are forced to wear white saris and live a simple life. It is thought that once their husbands are dead their lives are insignificant. They are believed to have passed the ‘centre of their lives’\n(refers to the husband, or to the time when their husband was alive; #patriarchy)\n\n\nThe women are like helpless fish caught in the net where they are anxiously\nwaiting for their liberation. \ntheir eyes have no joy or pleasure in life. \ntheir only hope lies in religious faith, in salvation \n\nwounds and disease make them helpless. The beggars suffer due to poverty. They stand in dim light of morning and beg. The hollowness of\nreligious rituals and truth of grim poverty has been perfectly described. \n\n‘leprous shell’ - we avoid them like they are lepers; negligence and apathy \nshell can mean body, in which case leprous signifies disease and wounds due to poverty and hinger \n\nHe is immediately reminded of his mother’s last wish of being cremated at Puri\nher last wish to be cremated here\n\n---\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.495656322Z","tags":["english","poem"]},"/Developmental-Research-Types-and-Ethical-Issues":{"title":"Developmental Research","content":"# Types of developmental research designs \n\n## Cross-sectional design \nA cross-sectional study compares the behaviors of **different age groups** at a **single time point**.\n\nmost common in developmental research \n\nless time-consuming and less expensive than the other methods \n\n## Longitudinal design\nexamine the **same** individuals over a period of time; **regular intervals**\n\nLongitudinal research takes time.

Researchers at Wake Forest University found that **trans fats**, which are created by partially hydrogenated oil, increase the amount of fat around the belly and redistribute fat tissue to the abdomen from other parts of the body. Trans fats may be found in such foods as margarine, pastries, cookies, crackers, and fried and convenience foods.\n2. **Visceral fat == dangerous**\n3. **verify** - *Extended fasting activates autophagy which clears out misfolded proteins and senescent cells in the entire body. HGH and NAD+ are upregulated. It selects for beneficial gut bacteria that not only do less damage to your digestive tract, but also drive healthy behavior via the gut-brain axis. Then you get into the insane mismatch of the promotion of maintenance of steady blood sugar via constant eating and our actual evolutionary history and the concomitant devastation that has on metabolic health.*\n4. **SLEEP IS IMPORTANT**\n5. **Check if strength training thing is true** \n   We lose **muscle mass as we age**. Strength training, such as lifting weights helps us build muscle. Muscles use up more energy and therefore burn more calories. \n   ***Weight training builds muscle, and muscle burns more calories than fat-up to three times more. \"So the more muscle you have, the more calories you're going to burn. It doesn't end after you leave the gym either. Your body is still torching calories for the next 24 to 48 hours as it works to repair stressed muscle tissues. That's known as the afterburn effect, another name for excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). The more oxygen you use both during and after a workout, the greater the EPOC.

Unhelpful thinking patterns. Again, reminder that these thought patterns probably evolved as a response to trauma, so please be kind to yourself.\n\n## Types of Cognitive Distortions\n\n**All-or-Nothing Thinking**: You see things in black and white categories. If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.\n\n**Over Generalization**: You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.\n\n**Mental Filter**: You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that discolours the entire beaker of water.\n\n**Disqualifying the Positive**: You reject positive experiences by insisting they \"don't count\" for some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your everyday experiences.\n\n**Jumping to Conclusion**: You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support you conclusions.\n\n**Mind Reading**: You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you, and you don't bother to check this out.\n\n**The Fortune Teller Error**: You anticipate that things will turn out badly, and you feel convinced that your prediction is an established fact.\n\n**Magnification (catastrophizing) or Minimization**: You exaggerate the importance of things, or you inappropriately shrink things until the appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or the other fellow's imperfections).\n\n**Emotional Reasoning**: You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: \"I feel it, therefore it must be true\".\n\n**Should Statements**: You try to motivate yourself with should and shouldn't, as if you had to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything.\n\n**Labelling** and **Mislabelling**: This is an extreme form of over generalization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: \"I’m a loser\". When someone else's behaviour rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to them.\n\n**Personalization**: You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event which in fact you were not primarily responsible for.\n\n---\n  \n  Everyone has cognitive distortions. Your cognitive distortions aren't your fault. It isn't your fault that you were dealt with situations where the brain had to adopt such behaviours, such styles of thinking. Be easy on yourself, you deserve that much \n\n---\n\nsee also: [[cognitive bias]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.495656322Z","tags":["psychology","tools"]},"/Distributed-Computing":{"title":"Distributed Computing","content":"\n## Distributed Computing \n\n\u003e \"A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system.\"\n\n ![distributedcomputing](images/distributedcomputing.svg)\n\na single task is divided **among multiple computers** that communicate with **each other over a network** \n\n### Features \nseveral **autonomous** computational entities called **NODES**\neach with their own local memory (no shared memory)\ncommunicate via **message passing** \nscalable  \n\ncan have master/slave relationship\ncan be peer-to-peer (p2p)\n\n### Elements of Distributed \n\n(a controller manages or directs the flow of data between two entities; example something that interfaces with the CPU and printer \nhandles the incoming and outgoing signals of the CPU)\n\n![distributed computing components](images/distributedcomputingcomponents.svg)\n**user interface client** \n\tprovides info \n\thelps monitor and control the system\n\tnot on the same system as primary controller usually\n\n**primary system controller** (??)\n_Main Controller_ \nwhich acts as a **broker** of information between the frontends and the solvers\nI/O access \nmaintains information, controls the management and dispatching of requests\n\n**secondary controller**\n\t*process or communications controller* \n\tregulating the flow of server processing requests and managing the system’s translation load\n\n**system datastore** \n\tshared system datastore, either in one computer or distributed among many \n\teach computer has local memory \n\tdifferent methods to store and retrieve information (file, block,object)\n\n***database*** \n\trelational database \n\tstore data in tables\n\tallows multiple users to access same info simultaneously \n\tshared database helps synchronization\n\n### Advantages of Distributed  \n- larger storage and memory, faster compute, and higher bandwidth than a single machine\n- might be more cost efficient (compared to a single big powerful computer)\n- no single point of failure\n- redundancy, fault tolerance \n- SCALABLE \n- **Decentralized**\n\n### Types \n1.

Eg - Place, smell, sound |  |\n| Internal Cue aka | State dependant cue |  |\n| Internal cue | State dependent cue. Internal factors like mood, emotion, nature, illness |  |\n| More types of memory | Explicit, Implicit. Flashbulb memories, autobiographical memories, prospective memory |  |\n| Explicit Memory | Intentional or conscious recollection of info. Remembering dates and events |  |\n| Implicit memory | Not directly aware. Can affect subsequent performance and behaviour. Eg - stu draws margin but doesnt remember who taught him or when |  |\n| Flashbulb memories | Vivid recollection of shocking or tragic events. Chance that facts get mixed with a little fiction. Special place in memory |  |\n| Autobiographical Memory | Episodic memory about events we have experienced |  |\n| Prospective Memory | Planning ahead for what we need to do later. Eg - alarm clock |  |\n| Mnemonics | Greek for memory techniques. Improve our ability to recall \u003cbr\u003e 1. Use of mnemonic devices. Flow charts, diagrams, charts, etc. \u003cbr\u003e 2.

Don't need all details; because it'll be a burden. Only summarization of important info. Forgetting unnecessary info is as important as the ability to recall |  |\n| Causes of forgetting | Lack of attention (sensory register to STM). Did not do required rehearsal (STM to LTM). Lack of proper cues |  |\n| Definition of Forgetting | Loss, permanent or temporary, of ability to recall or recognize something learnt earlier |  |\n| Kinds of Forgetting | Normal and Abnormal |  |\n| Normal Forgetting\u003cbr\u003e theories | Decay theory. \u003cbr\u003e Interference - retroactive, proactive. Accident. \u003cbr\u003e Emotional Shocks. \u003cbr\u003e State dependent memory |  |\n| Abnormal Forgetting | Alzheimer's, Motivated, Amnesia - retrograde, anterograde, Psychological Amnesia. Drugs, Alcohol, Toxic effects |  |\n| Decay Theory | Tend to forget with passage of time. Info entering LTM forms traces with constant use; more the use stronger the trace and remembrance. When not used, fades. |  |\n| Interference | Retroactive and Proactive |  |\n| Retroactive Interference | New learning interferes with info already present. Eg - |  |\n| Proactive Interference | Previously learnt information interferes with present learning |  |\n| Accident | Temp disturbances in blood can cause forgetting. Certain drugs, illnesses, fall from height, blow to the head, concussion |  |\n| Emotional Shocks | sudden shock eg sudden death can result in diff with retrieval of anxiety inducing information |  |\n| State Dependent memory | Encode in one emotional state and try to recall in another |  |\n| Alzheimer's | Severe memory loss. Result of disconnection of brain cells, begins with loss of STM. Names, faces, dates. |  |\n| Motivated Forgetting | Block from consciousness memories that are too painful to live. Repression. To deal with guilt, shame, shock. Sigmund Freud |  |\n| Amnesia | Retrograde - Memories before a particular event is lost. May regain in some days or years, may not regain at all. Anterograde - Inability to make new memories after injury / incident |  |\n| Psychological Amnesia | Childhood amnesia. Brain areas involving formation and storage are not developed. Stored in non-verbal form. Absence of cues |  |\n| Drugs, Alcohol, Toxic Effects | Addiction, prescription drugs, etc. |  |\n| POWER Learning | Prepare. Organize. Work. Evaluate.

Examples of wordmark logos are Google, Coca-Cola, and FedEx. Wordmark logos are simple, memorable, and versatile, but they require a strong name and a unique typography to stand out.\n\n- **Lettermark**: This type of logo uses the initials or acronym of the brand or company name, usually in a stylized font or design. Examples of lettermark logos are IBM, CNN, and NASA. Lettermark logos are concise, elegant, and easy to recognize, but they may not be very descriptive or distinctive for new or unfamiliar brands.\n\n- **Symbol / Logo Mark / brand mark**: This type of logo uses an icon or graphic that represents the brand or company, without any text. Examples of symbol logos are Apple, Nike, and Twitter. Symbol logos are expressive, universal, and adaptable, but they may require a lot of marketing and branding to establish a strong association with the name and identity of the brand or company.\n\n- **Combination**: This type of logo combines a symbol and a wordmark or lettermark, either side by side or integrated. Examples of combination logos are Adidas, Starbucks, and McDonald's. Combination logos are descriptive, distinctive, and flexible, but they may be complex or cluttered if not designed well\n\n- **Mascot**: A mascot logo is a type of logo that uses a drawn character to symbolize or promote a brand. The character can be imaginary or real, but it should match the brand’s personality and values. eg. Mr Peanut\n\n- **Emblem**:  aka badge logos, look like crests, combine imagery and text to give classic or a traditional feel eg.

The normal curve has a single peak at the mean of the data, and it falls off symmetrically on both sides. \n\nThe shape of the normal curve is determined by two parameters: the mean and the standard deviation. The mean indicates the location of the center of the curve, and the standard deviation measures the spread or variability of the data. \n\nThe normal curve has some important properties: about 68% of the data values are within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% are within two standard deviations, and about 99.7% are within three standard deviations.

He has to learn how to do this by himself, since no one can teach him. **(\"no singing school\")** \n\nThat is why he has traveled across the sea to the ancient sacred city of Byzantium. **There, he appeals to the wise men and saints who have died and become part of God’s glorious fire, which resembles the golden mosaics of Byzantine churches**. **He asks them to come out of the fire, spinning like a spool, and teach his soul to sing.** He wants them to destroy his mortal heart, which is bound to his dying body and cannot understand or accept its own mortality, and take him to their eternal world of art. \n\nWhen he leaves his body behind, he says he will not take another mortal form.\n\nInstead, he will become a \n**beautiful golden artwork**, like something made by **ancient Greek metal workers for an emperor’s bedroom**\nOr **a golden bird on a golden tree**, where he can teach people his everlasting and otherworldly wisdom - his transcendent knowledge of the past, present, and future.\n\n---\n\nAn aged man is but a paltry thing, A tattered coat upon a stick \n\nWhatever is begotten, born, and dies \n\nAs such, the speaker is basically imagining traveling to a long-dead holy city and talking to mosaic icons on a wall.

It was developed by Christine Miserandino in 2003 as a way to express how it felt to have lupus. She used spoons to provide a visual representation of units of energy that a person might have and how chronic illness forces her to plan out her days and actions in advance, so as not to run out of energy, or spoons, before the end of the day. It has since been applied to other phenomena, such as other disabilities, mental health issues, marginalization, and other factors that might place an extra – often unseen – burden on some individuals.\"  - [Wikipedia page for Spoon Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.499656358Z","tags":["resource","psychology","mentalhealth"]},"/Stages-Of-Birth":{"title":"Stages of birth","content":"\nThe Birth Process occurs in **three stages**\n\n## First Stage\nUterine contractions cause the woman's cervix to stretch and open\nDILATE the cervix to an opening of ~10cm so baby can move from uterus to birth canal\n\n## Second Stage\nBaby's head starts to move through the cervix and the birth canal.

This animal, in many ways so superior, has accepted a position of inferiority, shares the domestic life, and humours the caprices of the tyrant. But the potentate[^potentate], like the British in India, pays small regard to the character of his willing client, judges him with listless glances, and condemns him in a byword. Listless have been the looks of his admirers, who have exhausted idle terms of praise, and buried the poor soul below exaggerations. And yet more idle and, if possible, more unintelligent has been the attitude of his express detractors; those who are very fond of dogs \"but in their proper place\"; who say \"poo' fellow, poo' fellow,\" and are themselves far poorer; who whet the knife of the vivisectionist or heat his oven;[^2] who are not ashamed to admire \"the creature's instinct\"; and flying far beyond folly, have dared to resuscitate the theory of animal machines. The \"dog's instinct\" and the \"automaton-dog,\" in this age of psychology and science, sound like strange anachronisms. An automaton he certainly is; a machine working independently of his control, the heart like the mill-wheel, keeping all in motion, and the consciousness, like a person shut in the mill garret, enjoying the view out of the window and shaken by the thunder of the stones; an automaton in one corner of which a living spirit is confined: an automaton like man. Instinct again he certainly possesses. Inherited aptitudes are his, inherited frailties. Some things he at once views and understands, as though he were awakened from a sleep, as though he came \"trailing clouds of glory.\"[^3] But with him, as with man, the field of instinct is limited; its utterances are obscure and occasional; and about the far larger part of life both the dog and his master must conduct their steps by deduction and observation.\n\nThe leading distinction[^4] between dog and man, after and perhaps before the different duration of their lives, is that the one can speak and that the other cannot. The absence of the power of speech confines the dog in the development of his intellect. It hinders him from many speculations, for words are the beginning of metaphysic. At the same blow it saves him from many superstitions, and his silence has won for him a higher name for virtue than his conduct justifies. The faults of the dog[^5] are many. \n\nHe is vainer than man, singularly greedy of notice, singularly intolerant of ridicule, suspicious like the deaf, jealous to the degree of frenzy, and radically devoid of truth. The day of an intelligent small dog is passed in the manufacture and the laborious communication of falsehood; he lies with his tail, he lies with his eye, he lies with his protesting paw; and when he rattles his dish or scratches at the door his purpose is other than appears. But he has some apology to offer for the vice. Many of the signs which form his dialect have come to bear an arbitrary meaning, clearly understood both by his master and himself; yet when a new want arises he must either invent a new vehicle of meaning or wrest an old one to a different purpose; and this necessity frequently recurring must tend to lessen his idea of the sanctity of symbols. Meanwhile the dog is clear in his own conscience, and draws, with a human nicety, the distinction between formal and essential truth. Of his punning perversions, his legitimate dexterity with symbols, he is even vain; but when he has told and been detected in a lie, there is not a hair upon his body but confesses guilt. To a dog of gentlemanly feeling theft and falsehood are disgraceful vices. The canine, like the human, gentleman demands in his misdemeanours Montaigne's \"je ne sais quoi de genéréux.\"[^6] \n\nHe is never more than half ashamed of having barked or bitten; and for those faults into which he has been led by the desire to shine before a lady of his race, he retains, even under physical correction, a share of pride. But to be caught lying, if he understands it, instantly uncurls his fleece. Just as among dull observers he preserves a name for truth, the dog has been credited with modesty. It is amazing how the use of language blunts the faculties of man—-that because vainglory finds no vent in words, creatures supplied with eyes have been unable to detect a fault so gross and obvious. If a small spoiled dog were suddenly to be endowed with speech, he would prate interminably, and still about himself; when we had friends, we should be forced to lock him in a garret; and what with his whining jealousies and his foible for falsehood, in a year's time he would have gone far to weary out our love. I was about to compare him to Sir Willoughby Patterne,[^7] but the Patternes have a manlier sense of their own merits; and the parallel, besides, is ready. Hans Christian Andersen,[^8] as we behold him in his startling memoirs, thrilling from top to toe with an excruciating vanity, and scouting even along the street for shadows of offence—here was the talking dog.\n\nIt is just this rage for consideration that has betrayed the dog into his satellite position as the friend of man. The cat, an animal of franker appetites, preserves his independence. But the dog, with one eye ever on the audience, has been wheedled into slavery, and praised and patted into the renunciation of his nature. Once he ceased hunting[^9] and became man's plate-licker, the Rubicon was crossed. Thenceforth he was a gentleman of leisure; and except the few whom we keep working, the whole race grew more and more self-conscious, mannered and affected. The number of things that a small dog does naturally is strangely small. Enjoying better spirits and not crushed under material cares, he is far more theatrical than average man. His whole life, if he be a dog of any pretension to gallantry, is spent in a vain show, and in the hot pursuit of admiration. Take out your puppy for a walk, and you will find the little ball of fur clumsy, stupid, bewildered, but natural. Let but a few months pass, and when you repeat the process you will find nature buried in convention. He will do nothing plainly; but the simplest processes of our material life will all be bent into the forms of an elaborate and mysterious etiquette. Instinct, says the fool, has awakened. But it is not so. Some dogs—some, at the very least—if they be kept separate from others, remain quite natural; and these, when at length they meet with a companion of experience, and have the game explained to them, distinguish themselves by the severity of their devotion to its rules. \n\nI wish I were allowed to tell a story which would radiantly illuminate the point; but men, like dogs, have an elaborate and mysterious etiquette. It is their bond of sympathy that both are the children of convention.\n\nThe person, man or dog, who has a conscience is eternally condemned to some degree of humbug; the sense of the law in their members[^10] fatally precipitates either towards a frozen and affected bearing. And the converse is true; and in the elaborate and conscious manners of the dog, moral opinions and the love of the ideal stand confessed. To follow for ten minutes in the street some swaggering, canine cavalier, is to receive a lesson in dramatic art and the cultured conduct of the body; in every act and gesture you see him true to a refined conception; and the dullest cur, beholding him, pricks up his ear and proceeds to imitate and parody that charming ease. \n\nFor to be a high-mannered and high-minded gentleman, careless, affable, and gay, is the inborn pretension of the dog. The large dog, so much lazier, so much more weighed upon with matter, so majestic in repose, so beautiful in effort, is born with the dramatic means to wholly represent the part. And it is more pathetic and perhaps more instructive to consider the small dog in his conscientious and imperfect efforts to outdo Sir Philip Sidney.[^11] For the ideal of the dog is feudal and religious;[^12] the ever-present polytheism, the whip-bearing Olympus of mankind, rules them on the one hand; on the other, their singular difference of size and strength among themselves effectually prevents the appearance of the democratic notion. \n\nOr we might more exactly compare their society to the curious spectacle presented by a school—ushers, monitors, and big and little boys—qualified by one circumstance, the introduction of the other sex. In each, we should observe a somewhat similar tension of manner, and somewhat similar points of honour. In each the larger animal keeps a contemptuous good humour; in each the smaller annoys him with wasp-like impudence, certain of practical immunity; in each we shall find a double life producing double characters, and an excursive and noisy heroism combined with a fair amount of practical timidity. I have known dogs, and I have known school heroes that, set aside the fur, could hardly have been told apart; and if we desire to understand the chivalry of old, we must turn to the school playfields or the dungheap where the dogs are trooping.\n\nWoman, with the dog, has been long enfranchised. Incessant massacre of female innocents has changed the proportions of the sexes and perverted their relations. [^women]\n\nThus, when we regard the manners of the dog, we see a romantic and monogamous animal, once perhaps as delicate as the cat, at war with impossible conditions. Man has much to answer for; and the part he plays is yet more damnable and parlous[^13] than Corin's in the eyes of Touchstone. But his intervention has at least created an imperial situation for the rare surviving ladies. In that society they reign without a rival: conscious queens; and in the only instance of a canine wife-beater that has ever fallen under my notice, the criminal was somewhat excused by the circumstances of his story. He is a little, very alert, well-bred, intelligent Skye, as black as a hat, with a wet bramble for a nose and two cairn-gorms[^14] for eyes. \n\nTo the human observer, he is decidedly well-looking; but to the ladies of his race he seems abhorrent. A thorough elaborate gentleman, of the plume and sword-knot order, he was born with the nice sense of gallantry to women. He took at their hands the most outrageous treatment; I have heard him bleating like a sheep, I have seen him streaming blood, and his ear tattered like a regimental banner; and yet he would scorn to make reprisals. Nay more, when a human lady upraised the contumelious whip against the very dame who had been so cruelly misusing him, my little great-heart gave but one hoarse cry and fell upon the tyrant tooth and nail. This is the tale of a soul's tragedy.[^15] After three years of unavailing chivalry, he suddenly, in one hour, threw off the yoke of obligation; had he been Shakespeare he would then have written Troilus and Cressida[^16] to brand the offending sex; but being only a little dog, he began to bite them. The surprise of the ladies whom he attacked indicated the monstrosity of his offence; but he had fairly beaten off his better angel, fairly committed moral suicide; for almost in the same hour, throwing aside the last rags of decency, he proceeded to attack the aged also. The fact is worth remark, showing as it does, that ethical laws are common both to dogs and men; and that with both a single deliberate violation of the conscience loosens all. \n\n\"But while the lamp holds on to burn,\" says the paraphrase, \"the greatest sinner may return.\"[^17] I have been cheered to see symptoms of effectual penitence in my sweet ruffian; and by the handling that he accepted uncomplainingly the other day from an indignant fair one, I begin to hope the period of Sturm und Drang[^18] is closed.\n\nAll these little gentlemen are subtle casuists.[^casuist] The duty to the female dog is plain; but where competing duties rise, down they will sit and study them out like Jesuit confessors.[^19] I knew another little Skye, somewhat plain in manner and appearance, but a creature compact of amiability and solid wisdom. His family going abroad for a winter, he was received for that period by an uncle in the same city. The winter over, his own family home again, and his own house (of which he was very proud) reopened, he found himself in a dilemma between two conflicting duties of loyalty and gratitude. His old friends were not to be neglected, but it seemed hardly decent to desert the new. This was how he solved the problem. Every morning, as soon as the door was opened, off posted Coolin to his uncle's, visited the children in the nursery, saluted the whole family, and was back at home in time for breakfast and his bit of fish. \n\nNor was this done without a sacrifice on his part, sharply felt; for he had to forego the particular honour and jewel of his day—his morning's walk with my father. And perhaps, from this cause, he gradually wearied of and relaxed the practice, and at length returned entirely to his ancient habits. But the same decision served him in another and more distressing case of divided duty, which happened not long after. He was not at all a kitchen dog, but the cook had nursed him with unusual kindness during the distemper; and though he did not adore her as he adored my father—although (born snob) he was critically conscious of her position as \"only a servant\"—he still cherished for her a special gratitude. Well, the cook left, and retired some streets away to lodgings of her own; and there was Coolin in precisely the same situation with any young gentleman who has had the inestimable benefit of a faithful nurse. \n\nThe canine conscience did not solve the problem with a pound of tea at Christmas. No longer content to pay a flying visit, it was the whole forenoon that he dedicated to his solitary friend. And so, day by day, he continued to comfort her solitude until (for some reason which I could never understand and cannot approve) he was kept locked up to break him of the graceful habit. Here, it is not the similarity, it is the difference, that is worthy of remark; the clearly marked degrees of gratitude and the proportional duration of his visits. Anything further removed from instinct it were hard to fancy; and one is even stirred to a certain impatience with a character so destitute of spontaneity, so passionless in justice, and so priggishly obedient to the voice of reason.\n\nThere are not many dogs like this good Coolin. and not many people. But the type is one well marked, both in the human and the canine family. Gallantry was not his aim, but a solid and somewhat oppressive respectability. He was a sworn foe to the unusual and the conspicuous, a praiser of the golden mean, a kind of city uncle modified by Cheeryble.[^20] And as he was precise and conscientious in all the steps of his own blameless course, he looked for the same precision and an even greater gravity in the bearing of his deity, my father. It was no sinecure to be Coolin's idol; he was exacting like a rigid parent; and at every sign of levity in the man whom he respected, he announced loudly the death of virtue and the proximate fall of the pillars of the earth.\n\nI have called him a snob; but all dogs are so, though in varying degrees. It is hard to follow their snobbery among themselves; for though I think we can perceive distinctions of rank, we cannot grasp what is the criterion. Thus in Edinburgh, in a good part of the town, there were several distinct societies or clubs that met in the morning to—the phrase is technical—to \"rake the backets\"[^21] in a troop. A friend of mine, the master of three dogs, was one day surprised to observe that they had left one club and joined another; but whether it was a rise or a fall, and the result of an invitation or an expulsion, was more than he could guess. And this illustrates pointedly our ignorance of the real life of dogs, their social ambitions and their social hierarchies. At least, in their dealings with men they are not only conscious of sex, but of the difference of station. And that in the most snobbish manner; for the poor man's dog is not offended by the notice of the rich, and keeps all his ugly feeling for those poorer or more ragged than his master. And again, for every station they have an ideal of behaviour, to which the master, under pain of derogation, will do wisely to conform. How often has not a cold glance of an eye informed me that my dog was disappointed; and how much more gladly would he not have taken a beating than to be thus wounded in the seat of piety!\n\nI knew one disrespectable dog. He was far liker a cat; cared little or nothing for men, with whom he merely coexisted as we do with cattle, and was entirely devoted to the art of poaching. A house would not hold him, and to live in a town was what he refused. He led, I believe, a life of troubled but genuine pleasure, and perished beyond all question in a trap. But this was an exception, a marked reversion to the ancestral type; like the hairy human infant. The true dog of the nineteenth century, to judge by the remainder of my fairly large acquaintance, is in love with respectability. A street-dog was once adopted by a lady. While still an Arab, he had done as Arabs do, gambolling in the mud, charging into butchers' stalls, a cat-hunter, a sturdy beggar, a common rogue and vagabond; but with his rise into society he laid aside these inconsistent pleasures. He stole no more, he hunted no more cats; and conscious of his collar he ignored his old companions. Yet the canine upper class was never brought to recognize the upstart, and from that hour, except for human countenance, he was alone. Friendless, shorn of his sports and the habits of a lifetime, he still lived in a glory of happiness, content with his acquired respectability, and with no care but to support it solemnly. Are we to condemn or praise this self-made dog! We praise his human brother. And thus to conquer vicious habits is as rare with dogs as with men. With the more part, for all their scruple-mongering and moral thought, the vices that are born with them remain invincible throughout; and they live all their years, glorying in their virtues, but still the slaves of their defects. Thus the sage Coolin was a thief to the last; among a thousand peccadilloes, a whole goose and a whole cold leg of mutton lay upon his conscience; but Woggs,[^22] whose soul's shipwreck in the matter of gallantry I have recounted above, has only twice been known to steal, and has often nobly conquered the temptation. The eighth is his favourite commandment. There is something painfully human in these unequal virtues and mortal frailties of the best. Still more painful is the bearing of those \"stammering professors\"[^23] in the house of sickness and under the terror of death. It is beyond a doubt to me that, somehow or other, the dog connects together, or confounds, the uneasiness of sickness and the consciousness of guilt. To the pains of the body he often adds the tortures of the conscience; and at these times his haggard protestations form, in regard to the human deathbed, a dreadful parody or parallel.\n\nI once supposed that I had found an inverse relation between the double etiquette which dogs obey; and that those who were most addicted to the showy street life among other dogs were less careful in the practice of home virtues for the tyrant man. But the female dog, that mass of carneying[^24] affectations, shines equally in either sphere; rules her rough posse of attendant swains with unwearying tact and gusto; and with her master and mistress pushes the arts of insinuation to their crowning point. The attention of man and the regard of other dogs flatter (it would thus appear) the same sensibility; but perhaps, if we could read the canine heart, they would be found to flatter it in very marked degrees. \n\nDogs live with man as courtiers round a monarch, steeped in the flattery of his notice and enriched with sinecures. To push their favour in this world of pickings and caresses is, perhaps, the business of their lives; and their joys may lie outside. I am in despair at our persistent ignorance. I read in the lives of our companions the same processes of reason, the same antique and fatal conflicts of the right against the wrong, and of unbitted nature with too rigid custom; I see them with our weaknesses, vain, false, inconstant against appetite, and with our one stalk of virtue, devoted to the dream of an ideal; and yet, as they hurry by me on the street with tail in air, or come singly to solicit my regard, I must own the secret purport of their lives is still inscrutable to man. \n\nIs man the friend, or is he the patron only? Have they indeed forgotten nature's voice? or are those moments snatched from courtiership when they touch noses with the tinker's mongrel, the brief reward and pleasure of their artificial lives?\n\nDoubtless, when man shares with his dog the toils of a profession and the pleasures of an art, as with the shepherd or the poacher, the affection warms and strengthens till it fills the soul. But doubtless, also, the masters are, in many cases, the object of a merely interested cultus, sitting aloft like Louis Quatorze,[^25] giving and receiving flattery and favour; and the dogs, like the majority of men, have but forgotten their true existence and become the dupes of their ambition.\n\n---\n\nThis article originally appeared in The English Illustrated Magazine for May 1883, Vol. I, pp. 300-305. It was accompanied with illustrations by Randolph Caldecott. The essay was later included in the volume Memories and Portraits (1887).\n\nThe astonishing fidelity and devotion of the dog to his master have certainly been in part repaid by men of letters in all times. A valuable essay might be written on the Dog's Place in Literature; in the poetry of the East, hundreds of years before Christ, the dog's faithfulness was more than once celebrated. One of the most marvellous passages in Homer's Odyssey is the recognition of the ragged Ulysses by the noble old dog, who dies of joy. In recent years, since the publication of Dr. John Brown's Rab and his Friends (1858), the dog has approached an apotheosis. Among innumerable sketches and stories with canine heroes may be mentioned Bret Harte's extraordinary portrait of Boonder: M. Maeterlinck's essay on dogs: Richard Harding Davis's The Bar Sinister: Jack London's The Call of the Wild: and best of all, Alfred Ollivant's splendid story Bob, Son of Battle (1898) which has every indication of becoming an English classic. It is a pity that dogs cannot read.\n\n---\n\n[^1]:  The morals of dog-kind. Stevenson discusses this subject again in his essay Pulvis et Umbra (1888).\n\n\n[^2]:  Who whet the knife of the vivisectionist or heat his oven. Stevenson was so sympathetic by nature that once, seeing a man beating a dog, he interfered, crying, \"It's not your dog, it's God's dog.\" On the subject of vivisection, however his biographer says: \"It must be laid to the credit of his reason and the firm balance of his judgment that although vivisection was a subject he could not endure even to have mentioned, yet, with all his imagination and sensibility, he never ranged himself among the opponents of this method of inquiry, provided, of course, it was limited, as in England, with the utmost rigour possible.\"—Balfour's Life, II, 217. The two most powerful opponents of vivisection among Stevenson's contemporaries were Ruskin and Browning. The former resigned the Professorship of Poetry at Oxford because vivisection was permitted at the University: and the latter in two poems Tray and Arcades Ambo treated the vivisectionists with contempt, implying that they were cowards. In Bernard Shaw's clever novel Cashel Byron's Profession, The prize-fighter maintains that his profession is more honorable than that of a man who bakes dogs in an oven. This novel, by the way, which he read in the winter of 1887-88, made an extraordinary impression on Stevenson; he recognised its author's originality and cleverness immediately, and was filled with curiosity as to what kind of person this Shaw might be. \"Tell me more of the inimitable author,\" he cried. It is a pity that Stevenson did not live to see the vogue of Shaw as a dramatist, for the latter's early novels produced practically no impression on the public.

Stevenson argues that dogs are not mere instinctive machines, but intelligent and emotional beings who have adapted to human civilization and culture. He praises dogs for their loyalty, courage, affection and sense of humor, but also acknowledges their flaws such as vanity, jealousy, greed and dishonesty. He compares dogs with different breeds, countries and historical periods, and illustrates his points with anecdotes and observations. He concludes by expressing his admiration and love for dogs, and his hope that they will be treated with kindness and respect by their masters.\n\n# Important Lines\n\nThis animal, in many ways so superior, has accepted a position of inferiority, shares the domestic life, and humours the caprices of the tyrant \n\nBut the potentate, like the British in India, pays small regard to the character of his willing client, judges him with listless glances, and condemns him in a byword\n\nThe leading distinction between dog and man, after and perhaps before the different duration of their lives, is **that the one can speak and that the other cannot**.\n\nThe absence of the power of speech confines the dog in the development of his intellect. It hinders him from many speculations, for words are the beginning of metaphysic. \n**saves them from superstitions** \nand their silence has earned more praise for their virtues than justified\n\n\"faults of dogs\" - \n**He is vainer than man, singularly greedy of notice, singularly intolerant of ridicule, suspicious like the deaf, jealous to the degree of frenzy, and radically devoid of truth**\n\nMany of the signs which form his dialect have come to bear an arbitrary meaning, clearly understood both by his master and himself; yet when a new want arises he must either invent a new vehicle of meaning or rest an old one to a different purpose; and **this necessity frequently recurring must tend to lessen his idea of the sanctity of symbols.**\n\nIt is amazing how the use of language blunts the faculties of man—-that because vainglory finds no vent in words, creatures supplied with eyes have been unable to detect a fault so gross and obvious. \n\nIf a small spoiled dog were suddenly to be endowed with speech, he would prate interminably, and still about himself; when we had friends, we should be forced to lock him in a garret; and what with his whining jealousies and his foible for falsehood, in a year's time he would have gone far to weary out our love. [^explanation1]\n\nI was about to compare him to Sir Willoughby Patterne, but the Patternes have a manlier sense of their own merits; and the parallel, besides, is ready. Hans Christian Andersen, as we behold him in his startling memoirs, thrilling from top to toe with an excruciating vanity, and scouting even along the street for shadows of offence—here was the talking dog.\n\nThe cat, an animal of franker appetites, preserves his independence. But the dog, with one eye ever on the audience, has been wheedled into slavery, and praised and patted into the renunciation of his nature.\n\nOnce he ceased hunting and became man's plate-licker, the Rubicon was crossed.\n\nHis whole life, if he be a dog of any pretension to gallantry, is spent in a vain show, and in the hot pursuit of admiration.\n \nAnd it is more pathetic and perhaps more instructive to consider the small dog in his conscientious and imperfect efforts to outdo Sir Philip Sidney\n\n**For the ideal of the dog is feudal and religious; the ever-present polytheism, the whip-bearing Olympus of mankind, rules them on the one hand; on the other, their singular difference of size and strength among themselves effectually prevents the appearance of the democratic notion.**\n\n*He means that dogs have a worldview that is based on hierarchy and obedience. He compares **humans to a group of gods who have absolute power and authority over dogs**, and who can reward or punish them at will. He says that dogs are faithful and devoted to their human masters, and that they accept their position of inferiority and dependence. He also says that dogs have no sense of equality or democracy among themselves, because they vary so much in size and strength. He implies that dogs are ruled by fear and respect, and that they do not challenge or question the established order.*\n\n\n**Compares dogs to boys in school**\n in each we shall find a double life producing double characters, and an excursive and noisy heroism combined with a fair amount of practical timidity. I have known dogs, and I have known school heroes that, set aside the fur, could hardly have been told apart; and if we desire to understand the chivalry of old, we must turn to the school playfields or the dungheap where the dogs are trooping.\n\n\n\n**The fact is worth remark, showing as it does, that ethical laws are common both to dogs and men; and that with both a single deliberate violation of the conscience loosens all.**\n\nAll these little gentlemen are subtle casuists. The duty to the female dog is plain; but where competing duties rise, down they will sit and study them out like Jesuit confessors\n\n[^casuist]: - person who uses clever but unsound reasoning\n\n*Stevenson calls dogs casuists in this essay because they are **subtle reasoners** who try to justify their actions and **resolve moral dilemmas**. He gives examples of how dogs balance their loyalty and gratitude to different human friends, or how they distinguish between formal and essential truth when they lie or deceive. **He implies that dogs have a conscience and a sense of honor, but also a flexible morality that adapts to circumstances.** \n\ndogs are (born snob)\n\nAnd that in the most snobbish manner; for the poor man's dog is not offended by the notice of the rich, and keeps all his ugly feeling for those poorer or more ragged than his master.\n\n*He suggests that dogs are influenced by human society and culture, and that they adopt its values and prejudices.*\n\n[^explanation1]: Stevenson means that humans are often blind to the vanity and selfishness of dogs, because dogs cannot express their thoughts and feelings in words. **He thinks that if dogs could talk, they would reveal their true nature, which is full of pride, envy, and lies**. He imagines that a spoiled dog who could talk would annoy and bore his human friends with his endless chatter about himself, and that they would soon lose their affection for him. He implies that dogs are better off being silent, because their silence makes them more lovable and respectable.\n\n[^overall]: - I partially agree with Stevenson’s view of dogs. I think he is right that dogs have complex personalities and emotions, and that they are not mere instinctive machines. I also think he is right that dogs are influenced by human society and culture, and that they have adapted to human civilization and manners. However, I think he is too harsh and cynical in his judgment of dogs’ faults. I think he exaggerates the vanity, jealousy, and dishonesty of dogs, and overlooks their virtues. I think he fails to appreciate the diversity and individuality of dogs, and generalizes too much from his own experience. I think he is biased by his own human perspective, and does not try to understand dogs on their own terms. I think dogs are more than silent companions or spoiled children; they are intelligent and loyal partners who can enrich our lives with their love and joy.\n\n# Important Points \n-   Stevenson explores the similarities and differences between dogs and humans, especially in their moral and social qualities.\n-   He argues that dogs are influenced by their relationship with humans, who have made them into slaves and companions, but also by their own natural instincts and preferences.\n-   He describes various types of dogs, such as the small dog who is vain and deceitful, the large dog who is majestic and dignified, the snobbish dog who cares for respectability, and the disrespectable dog who lives as a poacher.\n-   He admires the dog’s sense of loyalty, gratitude, and chivalry, but also criticizes his vices of vanity, greediness, jealousy, and falsehood.\n-   He compares the dog’s society to that of a school or a feudal system, where there are ranks, clubs, codes of honour, and ideals of behaviour.\n-   He concludes that dogs are not mere machines or instinctive animals, but complex and intelligent creatures who have a conscience and a character.\n- He is talking about how the relationship between dogs and humans varies depending on their occupation and lifestyle. He says that when a man and his dog work together and share a common interest, such as a shepherd or a poacher, their bond becomes stronger and deeper. They become true friends and partners, who understand and appreciate each other. But he also says that in many cases, the masters are like kings who demand and give loyalty and praise, and the dogs are like subjects who have lost their true identity and become slaves to their ambition. They worship their masters for their power and status, but they do not have a genuine connection or respect. He implies that this is a sad and false situation, where both the dogs and the humans are deceived by their vanity and pride.\n\n\n\n[^women]:He is talking about how humans have interfered with the natural balance of the dog population by killing many female dogs for various reasons. He says that this has made the female dogs very rare and valuable in the dog society, where they are treated like queens by the male dogs. He compares this situation to the human society, where women have been oppressed and exploited by men for a long time. He also mentions a literary reference to Shakespeare’s play “As You Like It”, where Corin is a simple shepherd who does not understand the sophisticated manners of Touchstone, a court jester. He implies that humans are like Touchstone, who mocks and criticizes Corin for his ignorance and simplicity. He says that humans have a worse and more dangerous role than Corin, because they have harmed and corrupted the dog’s nature. He also gives an example of a rare case of a dog who abused his female partner, but he says that there was some justification for his behavior because of his past history.\n\n\nHe is a little black Skye terrier who was once kidnapped and tortured by some boys. He managed to escape and return to his owners, but he became very nervous and irritable. He would often snap at his female partner, a gentle and beautiful Skye terrier, and sometimes even bite her. Stevenson says that he was somewhat excused by the circumstances of his story, but he also says that he was ashamed of his behavior and would try to make up for it by being more affectionate and attentive to his partner.\n\nWoggs \nWoggs, who was very polite and chivalrous to female dogs. He says that Woggs was a gentleman who wore a feather and a ribbon on his collar, and he had a high sense of honour and respect for women. He says that Woggs would endure any abuse or injury from female dogs without fighting back or complaining. He gives an example of how Woggs was once attacked by a female dog who bit his ear and made him bleed. But when a human woman tried to whip the female dog for her bad behavior, Woggs defended her and attacked the woman instead. He says that this is the story of a **soul’s tragedy**, meaning that Woggs was a noble and loyal dog who suffered because of his love and devotion to female dogs\n\n# dogs he mentions \n1) Woggs \n   Stevenson's blue skye terrier; even mentioned in *The Life of Robert Louis Stevenson by Sir Graham Balfour*\n   canine wife-beater\n2) Coolin \n3) Arab dog that rose to \"upper dog class\" but was ignored by fellow upper class dogs (??) this left him lonely. we celebrate self made men but what about dogs?

This is based on an essay by Garrett Hardin in 1968 which utilized an example by William Forster Lloyd. [[Tragedy of Commons#Original Hypothetical Scenario|1]]\n\n\n\n# Original Hypothetical Scenario \nby William Forster Lloyd in 1883 \nThis was a scenario where cow herders shared a common plot of land where they were each permitted to let their cows to graze, as was typical in English villages. In his theory, overgrazing might happen if a herder brings more cattle to the common than he is allowed to. A herder could benefit more from having more animals while also sharing the costs associated with the commons' resulting damage. The common could be depleted or even destroyed to the detriment of all herders if they all made this individually rational economic choice.\n\n\n\u003e Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit – in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons\n\t **— Garrett Hardin, The Tragedy of the Commons**\n\n# Aristotle\nNot exactly about the tragedy of commons but same underlying principle - \n\u003e*\"That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care.

For example, if overbreeding happened in nature, it would automatically reduce due to negative feedback. The resources would reduce and therefore, the overbreeding species in question would not have enough resources and die out. Welfare states provide for children and support overbreeding as a fundamental human right, according to him \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.503656393Z","tags":["politics","social"]},"/Types-of-Birth":{"title":"Types of Birth","content":"\n## Natural \naims to decrease pain by decreasing fear through education about childbirth and breathing techniques are used\n\t1.

A kids' TV show host at that. \n\n\"Pfft, why aren't you over a kids' TV show host, you're 21!\" \n\nWell... because he wasn't just any TV show host, he was this Presbyterian minister who didn't like what was displayed on kids television shows, so he went out to change that.\n\n\"Umm. Isn't shitting on religious conservatives who are offended by innocuous things YOUR THING? Basically, your favourite hobby?\"\na) That isn't my favourite hobby, that's my second favourite one. \nb) Shame on you for jumping to conclusions and thinking that Christian minister = conservative, and for discarding his ideas just because of his beliefs.\n\n\"But, I'm just reading what you wrote! I'm one of your voice-\"\n\nAnyway, with all the distractions now gone, let's get back. **Fred Rogers**. A man who wanted to do something to change how kids' programmes were violent, mindless, and provided no value. My initial knee-jerk reaction to this was \"OMG, don't kill the fun!\", but then I saw the things he accomplished. Most notably, Mr Rogers' Neighborhood. Imagine the coziest, fluffiest, warmest thing you can. That's Mr Rogers' Neighbourhood.\n\nI can't do it justice, so I'll simply direct you to https://www.misterrogers.org/our-television-neighbor/.\n\nAnd for the lazy ones, here's an excerpt that does more justice than I did, but still not enough justice - _Over more than 30 years Mister Rogers created a relationship with millions of children, each of whom felt like they were visiting with a trusted friend. Mister Rogers looked directly into the camera and sang and talked to each child watching. His radical kindness, acceptance, and empathy created a place that as TV Guide described: “ **makes us, young and old alike, feel safe, cared for and valued… Wherever Mister Rogers is, so is sanctuary.**”\n\nWow, so I can't believe I just spent the entire time JUST trying to introduce Mister Rogers and still butchering it.\n\nBut anyway, I _adore_ Mr Rogers. I've never been the kind of person to have a role model. (Don't put people on a pedestal, right?) I never really found anyone who was amazing enough to be role model material, you know? But Mr Rogers? Him I can confidently call my role model.\n\nWhy did his work resonate so much with me? Because... Our beliefs were aligned! When I was around 15, I was struck by what I called an epiphany but now call common sense. I came to the (not so) startling conclusion that most \"bad behaviour\", as I termed it then, could be traced back to a bad childhood. I postulated that most crimes happen because of fucked up childhoods. Of course, it is more nuanced than that, but it really does hold true to a certain extent. Childhood shapes us. It's the most important part of our lives, but I feel like we don't give it enough importance. Kids will be kids. No! They'll grow up to be ill-functioning caffeine-addicted adults someday!\n\nMr Rogers understood this. He understood the importance of love and empathy. Of kindness. Of self-acceptance. On his show, he made sure that everyone felt like they had a friend. He extended love.\n\nBut that's not it. It wasn't just the fact that I shared his view, or the general altruistic feel-goodness that made me connect with Mister Rogers. It was something more personal. He told me things I've always wanted to hear. It might sound weird to picture a grown-ass adult crying at Mr Rogers singing \"It's you I like\", but I found out I wasn't the only one. I introduced it to my then-partner and they did the same. Both of us had a fragmented childhood and it just hit us right in the feels. Do yourself a favour and listen to it. https://misterrogers.org/videos/its-you-i-like/\n\nLook at the lyrics and tell me you didn't feel a thing -\n\nIt's you I like, It's not the things you wear, It's not the way you do your hair-- But it's you I like. The way you are right now, The way down deep inside you-- Not the things that hide you, Not your toys-- They're just beside you.\n\nBut it's you I like-- Every part of you, Your skin, your eyes, your feelings Whether old or new. I hope that you'll remember Even when you're feeling blue That it's you I like, It's you yourself, It's you, it's you I like.\n\n(It's okay if the lyrics didn't do anything to you, Mister Rogers loves you regardless)\n\nMr Rogers was the father I never had. The friend I never had. But the one all of us need, especially in these bleak times. His show wasn't just some silly show, the little details that make up the show are just so beautiful; I urge you to explore.\n\nHe covered serious issues. From divorce to death and everything in between, Mister Rogers talked about, gently. In a way that a child can understand. He helped them process their feelings. “Whatever is mentionable can be more manageable.” Mr Rogers normalised so many things and made help more accessible.\n\n\"He understood that new experiences or changes in routine can feel overwhelming and scary to young children. He showed us what to expect. He reassured us. He prepared us to meet and trust the people who would care for us – the doctor, the dentist, the barber, the teacher.\" He'd cover things most people would deem mundane, things most networks would take a hard pass on.\n\nHe treated children with respect and saw them as equals; he didn't patronise them. He actually listened.\n\nThe best part? The lessons he taught aren't exclusively for children. A lot of us could use them too. They're cathartic, trust me.\n\nI have a large collection of Mister Rogers quotes, but I'll leave you with these.\n\n\u003e “Everyone longs to be loved. And the greatest thing we can do is to let people know that they are loved and capable of loving.”\n\n\u003e \"Imagine what our real neighborhoods would be like if each of us offered, as a matter of course, just one kind word to another person.\"\n\n**I never thought I'd quote Tommy Wiseau in a post about Fred Rogers, but - \"If a lot of people love each other, the world would be a better place to live.\"** True Tommy, I'm with you on that. If only everyone were more true to their feelings. But maybe we'll get there!\nI'll wind up this needlessly lengthy post that didn't manage to capture an ounce of the legacy that Mr Rogers has left with a quote that I really love and find comforting.\n\n\u003e _“**When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, “Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.”**_\n\nLook for the helpers. Not to be dramatic, but this phrase sorta reignited my faith in humanity, kinda helped me view everything a bit differently, you know?\n\nThank you, Fred McFeely Rogers. Thank you for reminding me of the oath I took as a kid. To spread love, respect, and happiness no matter what. I have faltered, I have gone astray, but I am giving it my best.","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":["wholesome","people","blog"]},"/meta/external/Can-you-say-hero":{"title":"Can You Say...Hero?","content":"\n# Can You Say...Hero? - Mr. Rogers Profile Interview\n\n\n_This article was originally published in the November 1998 issue._\n\nOnce upon a time, a little boy loved a stuffed animal whose name was Old Rabbit. It was so old, in fact, that it was really an unstuffed animal; so old that even back then, with the little boy's brain still nice and fresh, he had no memory of it as \"Young Rabbit,\" or even \"Rabbit\"; so old that Old Rabbit was barely a rabbit at all but rather a greasy hunk of skin without eyes and ears, with a single red stitch where its tongue used to be. The little boy didn't know why he loved Old Rabbit; he just did, and the night he threw it out the car window was the night he learned how to pray. He would grow up to become a great prayer, this little boy, but only intermittently, only fitfully, praying only when fear and desperation drove him to it, and the night he threw Old Rabbit into the darkness was the night that set the pattern, the night that taught him how. He prayed for Old Rabbit's safe return, and when, hours later, his mother and father came home with the filthy, precious strip of rabbity roadkill, he learned not only that prayers are sometimes answered but also the kind of severe effort they entail, the kind of endless frantic summoning. And so when he threw Old Rabbit out the car window the _next time_, it was gone for good.\n\n___\n\nYou were a child once, too. That's what Mister Rogers said, that's what he wrote down, once upon a time, for the doctors. The doctors were ophthalmologists. An ophthalmologist is a doctor who takes care of the eyes. Sometimes, ophthalmologists have to take care of the eyes of children, and some children get very scared, because children know that their world disappears when their eyes close, and they can be afraid that the ophthalmologists will make their eyes close forever. The ophthalmologists did not want to scare children, so they asked Mister Rogers for help, and Mister Rogers agreed to write a chapter for a book the ophthalmologists were putting together—a chapter about what other ophthalmologists could do to calm the children who came to their offices. Because Mister Rogers is such a busy man, however, he could not write the chapter himself, and he asked a woman who worked for him to write it instead. She worked very hard at writing the chapter, until one day she showed what she had written to Mister Rogers, who read it and crossed it all out and wrote a sentence addressed directly to the doctors who would be reading it: \"You were a child once, too.\"\n\nAnd that's how the chapter began.\n\n___\n\nThe old navy-blue sport jacket comes off first, then the dress shoes, except that now there is not the famous sweater or the famous sneakers to replace them, and so after the shoes he's on to the dark socks, peeling them off and showing the blanched skin of his narrow feet. The tie is next, the scanty black batwing of a bow tie hand-tied at his slender throat, and then the shirt, always white or light blue, whisked from his body button by button. He wears an undershirt, of course, but no matter—soon that's gone, too, as is the belt, as are the beige trousers, until his undershorts stand as the last impediment to his nakedness. They are boxers, egg-colored, and to rid himself of them he bends at the waist, and stands on one leg, and hops, and lifts one knee toward his chest and then the other and then… Mister Rogers has no clothes on.\n\nNearly every morning of his life, Mister Rogers has gone swimming, and now, here he is, standing in a locker room, seventy years old and as white as the Easter Bunny, rimed with frost wherever he has hair, gnawed pink in the spots where his dry skin has gone to flaking, slightly wattled at the neck, slightly stooped at the shoulder, slightly sunken in the chest, slightly curvy at the hips, slightly pigeoned at the toes, slightly aswing at the fine bobbing nest of himself… and yet when he speaks, it is in that voice, his voice, the famous one, the unmistakable one, the televised one, the voice dressed in sweater and sneakers, the soft one, the reassuring one, the curious and expository one, the sly voice that sounds adult to the ears of children and childish to the ears of adults, and what he says, in the midst of all his bobbing nudity, is as understated as it is obvious: \"Well, Tom, I guess you've already gotten a deeper glimpse into my daily routine than most people have.\"\n\n___\n\nOnce upon a time, a long time ago, a man took off his jacket and put on a sweater. Then he took off his shoes and put on a pair of sneakers. His name was Fred Rogers. He was starting a television program, aimed at children, called _Mister Rogers' Neighborhood_. He had been on television before, but only as the voices and movements of puppets, on a program called _The Children's Corner_. Now he was stepping in front of the camera as Mister Rogers, and he wanted to do things right, and whatever he did right, he wanted to repeat. And so, once upon a time, Fred Rogers took off his jacket and put on a sweater his mother had made him, a cardigan with a zipper. Then he took off his shoes and put on a pair of navy-blue canvas boating sneakers. He did the same thing the next day, and then the next…until he had done the same things, those things, 865 times, at the beginning of 865 television programs, over a span of thirty-one years. The first time I met Mister Rogers, he told me a story of how deeply his simple gestures had been felt, and received. He had just come back from visiting Koko, the gorilla who has learned—or who has been taught—American Sign Language. Koko watches television. Koko watches _Mister Rogers' Neighborhood_, and when Mister Rogers, in his sweater and sneakers, entered the place where she lives, Koko immediately folded him in her long, black arms, as though he were a child, and then … \"She took my shoes off, Tom,\" Mister Rogers said.\n\n\u003e You were a child once, too. That's what Mister Rogers said, that's what he wrote down, once upon a time.\n\nKoko was much bigger than Mister Rogers. She weighed 280 pounds, and Mister Rogers weighed 143. Koko weighed 280 pounds because she is a gorilla, and Mister Rogers weighed 143 pounds because he has weighed 143 pounds as long as he has been Mister Rogers, because once upon a time, around thirty-one years ago, Mister Rogers stepped on a scale, and the scale told him that Mister Rogers weighs 143 pounds. No, not that he _weighed_ 143 pounds, but that he _weighs_ 143 pounds…. And so, every day, Mister Rogers refuses to do anything that would make his weight change—he neither drinks, nor smokes, nor eats flesh of any kind, nor goes to bed late at night, nor sleeps late in the morning, nor even watches television—and every morning, when he swims, he steps on a scale in his bathing suit and his bathing cap and his goggles, and the scale tells him that he weighs 143 pounds. This has happened so many times that Mister Rogers has come to see that number as a gift, as a destiny fulfilled, because, as he says, \"the number 143 means 'I love you.' It takes one letter to say 'I' and four letters to say 'love' and three letters to say 'you.' One hundred and forty-three. 'I love you.' Isn't that wonderful?\"\n\n___\n\nThe first time I called Mister Rogers on the telephone, I woke him up from his nap. He takes a nap every day in the late afternoon—just as he wakes up every morning at five-thirty to read and study and write and pray for the legions who have requested his prayers; just as he goes to bed at nine-thirty at night and sleeps eight hours without interruption. On this afternoon, the end of a hot, yellow day in New York City, he was very tired, and when I asked if I could go to his apartment and see him, he paused for a moment and said shyly, \"Well, Tom, I'm in my bathrobe, if you don't mind.\" I told him I didn't mind, and when, five minutes later, I took the elevator to his floor, well, sure enough, there was Mister Rogers, silver-haired, standing in the golden door at the end of the hallway and wearing eyeglasses and suede moccasins with rawhide laces and a flimsy old blue-and-yellow bathrobe that revealed whatever part of his skinny white calves his dark-blue dress socks didn't hide. \"Welcome, Tom,\" he said with a slight bow, and bade me follow him inside, where he lay down—no, _stretched out_, as though he had known me all his life—on a couch upholstered with gold velveteen. He rested his head on a small pillow and kept his eyes closed while he explained that he had bought the apartment thirty years before for $11,000 and kept it for whenever he came to New York on business for the Neighborhood. I sat in an old armchair and looked around. The place was drab and dim, with the smell of stalled air and a stain of daguerreotype sunlight on its closed, slatted blinds, and Mister Rogers looked so at home in its gloomy familiarity that I thought he was going to fall back asleep when suddenly the phone rang, startling him. \"Oh, hello, my dear,\" he said when he picked it up, and then he said that he had a visitor, someone who wanted to learn more about the Neighborhood. \"Would you like to speak to him?\" he asked, and then handed me the phone. \"It's Joanne,\" he said. I took the phone and spoke to a woman—his wife, the mother of his two sons—whose voice was hearty and almost whooping in its forthrightness and who spoke to me as though she had known me for a long time and was making the effort to keep up the acquaintance. When I handed him back the phone, he said, \"Bye, my dear,\" and hung up and curled on the couch like a cat, with his bare calves swirled underneath him and one of his hands gripping his ankle, so that he looked as languorous as an odalisque. There was an energy to him, however, a fearlessness, an unashamed insistence on intimacy, and though I tried to ask him questions about himself, he always turned the questions back on me, and when I finally got him to talk about the puppets that were the comfort of his lonely boyhood, he looked at me, his gray-blue eyes at once mild and steady, and asked,\n\n\"What about you, Tom? Did you have any special friends growing up?\"\n\n\"Special friends?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Maybe a puppet, or a special toy, or maybe just a stuffed animal you loved very much. Did you have a special friend like that, Tom?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mister Rogers.\"\n\n\"Did your special friend have a name, Tom?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mister Rogers. His name was Old Rabbit.\"\n\n\"Old Rabbit. Oh, and I'll bet the two of you were together since he was a very young rabbit. Would you like to tell me about Old Rabbit, Tom?\"\n\nAnd it was just about then, when I was spilling the beans about my special friend, that Mister Rogers rose from his corner of the couch and stood suddenly in front of me with a small black camera in hand. \"Can I take your picture, Tom?\" he asked. \"I'd like to take your picture. I like to take pictures of all my new friends, so that I can show them to Joanne....\" And then, in the dark room, there was a wallop of white light, and Mister Rogers disappeared behind it.\n\n___\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a boy who didn't like himself very much. It was not his fault. He was born with cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is something that happens to the brain. It means that you can think but sometimes can't walk, or even talk. This boy had a very bad case of cerebral palsy, and when he was still a little boy, some of the people entrusted to take care of him took advantage of him instead and did things to him that made him think that he was a very bad little boy, because only a bad little boy would have to live with the things he had to live with. In fact, when the little boy grew up to be a teenager, he would get so mad at himself that he would hit himself, hard, with his own fists and tell his mother, on the computer he used for a mouth, that he didn't want to live anymore, for he was sure that God didn't like what was inside him any more than he did. He had always loved Mister Rogers, though, and now, even when he was fourteen years old, he watched the Neighborhood whenever it was on, and the boy's mother sometimes thought that Mister Rogers was keeping her son alive. She and the boy lived together in a city in California, and although she wanted very much for her son to meet Mister Rogers, she knew that he was far too disabled to travel all the way to Pittsburgh, so she figured he would never meet his hero, until one day she learned through a special foundation designed to help children like her son that Mister Rogers was coming to California and that after he visited the gorilla named Koko, he was coming to meet her son.\n\n\u003e There was an energy to him, however, a fearlessness, an unashamed insistence on intimacy.\n\nAt first, the boy was made very nervous by the thought that Mister Rogers was visiting him. He was so nervous, in fact, that when Mister Rogers did visit, he got mad at himself and began hating himself and hitting himself, and his mother had to take him to another room and talk to him. Mister Rogers didn't leave, though. He wanted something from the boy, and Mister Rogers never leaves when he wants something from somebody. He just waited patiently, and when the boy came back, Mister Rogers talked to him, and then he made his request. He said, \"I would like you to do something for me. Would you do something for me?\" On his computer, the boy answered yes, of course, he would do _anything_ for Mister Rogers, so then Mister Rogers said, \"I would like you to pray for me. Will you pray for me?\" And now the boy didn't know how to respond. He was thunderstruck. Thunderstruck means that you can't talk, because something has happened that's as sudden and as miraculous and maybe as scary as a bolt of lightning, and all you can do is listen to the rumble. The boy was thunderstruck because nobody had ever _asked_ him for something like that, ever. The boy had always been prayed _for_. The boy had always been the _object_ of prayer, and now he was being asked to pray for Mister Rogers, and although at first he didn't know if he could do it, he said he would, he said he'd try, and ever since then he keeps Mister Rogers in his prayers and doesn't talk about wanting to die anymore, because he figures Mister Rogers is close to God, and if Mister Rogers likes him, that must mean God likes him, too.\n\nAs for Mister Rogers himself…well, he doesn't look at the story in the same way that the boy did or that I did. In fact, when Mister Rogers first told me the story, I complimented him on being so smart—for knowing that asking the boy for his prayers would make the boy feel better about himself—and Mister Rogers responded by looking at me at first with puzzlement and then with surprise. \"Oh, heavens no, Tom! I didn't ask him for his prayers for _him_; I asked for me. I asked him because I think that anyone who has gone through challenges like that must be very close to God. I asked him because I wanted his _intercession_.\"\n\n___\n\nOn December 1, 1997—oh, heck, once upon a time—a boy, no longer little, told his friends to watch out, that he was going to do something \"really big\" the next day at school, and the next day at school he took his gun and his ammo and his earplugs and shot eight classmates who had clustered for a prayer meeting. Three died, and they were still children, almost. The shootings took place in West Paducah, Kentucky, and when Mister Rogers heard about them, he said, \"Oh, wouldn't the world be a different place if he had said, 'I'm going to do something really _little_ tomorrow,'\" and he decided to dedicate a week of the Neighborhood to the theme \"Little and Big.\" He wanted to tell children that what starts out little can sometimes _become_ big, and so that could devote themselves to little dreams without feeling bad about them. But how could Mister Rogers _show_ little becoming big, and vice versa? That was a challenge. He couldn't just say it, the way he could always just say to the children who watch his program that they are special to him, or even sing it, the way he would always sing \"It's You I Like\" and \"Everybody's Fancy\" and \"It's Such a Good Feeling\" and \"Many Ways to Say I Love You\" and \"Sometimes People Are Good.\" No, he had to show it, he had to demonstrate it, and that's how Mister Rogers and the people who work for him eventually got the idea of coming to New York City to visit a woman named Maya Lin.\n\nMaya Lin is a famous architect. Architects are people who create big things from the little designs they draw on pieces of paper. Most famous architects are famous for creating big famous buildings, but Maya Lin is more famous for creating big fancy things for people to look at, and in fact, when Mister Rogers had gone to her studio the day before, he looked at the pictures she had drawn of the clock that is now on the ceiling of a place in New York called Penn Station. A clock is a machine that tells people what time it is, but as Mister Rogers sat in the backseat of an old station wagon hired to take him from his apartment to Penn Station, he worried that Maya Lin's clock might be _too_ fancy and that the children who watch the Neighborhood might not understand it. Mister Rogers always worries about things like that, because he always worries about children, and when his station wagon stopped in traffic next to a bus stop, he read aloud the advertisement of an airline trying to push its international service. \"Hmmm,\" Mister Rogers said, \"_that's_ a strange ad. 'Most people think of us as a great domestic airline. We _hate_ that.' Hmmm. _Hate_ is such a strong word to use so lightly. If they can hate something like that, you wonder how easy it would be for them to hate something more important.\" He was with his producer, Margy Whitmer. He had makeup on his face and a dollop of black dye combed into his silver hair. He was wearing beige pants, a blue dress shirt, a tie, dark socks, a pair of dark-blue boating sneakers, and a purple, zippered cardigan. He looked very little in the backseat of the car. Then the car stopped on Thirty-fourth Street, in front of the escalators leading down to the station, and when the doors opened—\"Holy shit! It's Mister Fucking Rogers!\"—he turned into Mister Fucking Rogers. This was not a bad thing, however, because he was in New York, and in New York it's not an insult to be called Mister Fucking Anything. In fact, it's an honorific. An honorific is what people call you when they respect you, and the moment Mister Rogers got out of the car, people wouldn't stay the fuck away from him, they respected him so much. Oh, Margy Whitmer tried to keep people away from him, tried to tell people that if they gave her their names and addresses, Mister Rogers would send them an autographed picture, but every time she turned around, there was Mister Rogers putting his arms around someone, or wiping the tears off someone's cheek, or passing around the picture of someone's child, or getting on his knees to talk to a child. Margy couldn't stop them, and she couldn't stop him. \"Oh, Mister Rogers, thank you for my childhood.\" \"Oh, Mister Rogers, you're the father I never had.\" \"Oh, Mister Rogers, would you please just hug me?\" After a while, Margy just rolled her eyes and gave up, because it's always like this with Mister Rogers, because the thing that people don't understand about him is that he's _greedy_ for this—greedy for the grace that people offer him. What is grace? He doesn't even know. He can't define it. This is a man who loves the simplifying force of definitions, and yet all he knows of grace is how he gets it; all he knows is that he gets it from God, through man. And so in Penn Station, where he was surrounded by men and women and children, he had this _power_, like a comic-book superhero who absorbs the energy of others until he bursts out of his shirt.\n\n\u003e He wanted to tell children that what starts out little can sometimes _become_ big, and so that could devote themselves to little dreams without feeling bad about them.\n\n\"If Mister Fucking Rogers can tell me how to read that fucking clock, I'll watch his show every day for a fucking _year_\"—that's what someone in the crowd said while watching Mister Rogers and Maya Lin crane their necks at Maya Lin's big fancy clock, but it didn't even matter whether Mister Rogers could read the clock or not, because every time he looked at it, with the television cameras on him, he leaned back from his waist and opened his mouth wide with astonishment, like someone trying to catch a peanut he had tossed into the air, until it became clear that Mister Rogers could show that he was astonished all _day_ if he had to, or even forever, because Mister Rogers lives in a _state_ of astonishment, and the astonishment he showed when he looked at the clock was the same astonishment he showed when people—absolute strangers—walked up to him and fed his hungry ear with their whispers, and he turned to me, with an open, abashed mouth, and said, \"Oh, Tom, if you could only hear the stories I hear!\"\n\n___\n\nOnce upon a time, Mister Rogers went to New York City and got caught in the rain. He didn't have an umbrella, and he couldn't find a taxi, either, so he ducked with a friend into the subway and got on one of the trains. It was late in the day, and the train was crowded with children who were going home from school. Though of all races, the schoolchildren were mostly black and Latino, and they didn't even approach Mister Rogers and ask him for his autograph. They just sang. They sang, all at once, all together, the song he sings at the start of his program, \"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\" and turned the clattering train into a single soft, runaway choir.\n\n___\n\nHe finds me, of course, at Penn Station. He finds me, because that's what Mister Rogers _does_—he looks, and then he finds. I'm standing against a wall, listening to a bunch of mooks from Long Island discuss the strange word—cariz —a foreign word—he has written down on each of the autographs he gave them. First mook: \"He says it's the Greek word for grace.\" Second mook: \"Huh. That's cool. I'm glad I know that. Now, what the fuck is grace?\" First mook: \"Looks like you're gonna have to break down and buy a dictionary.\" Second mook: \"Fuck that. What I'm buying is a ticket to the fucking _Lotto_. I just met Mister Rogers—this is _definitely_ my lucky day.\" I'm listening to these guys when, from thirty feet away, I notice Mister Rogers looking around for someone and know, immediately, that he is looking for me. He is on one knee in front of a little girl who is hoarding, in her arms, a small stuffed animal, sky-blue, a bunny.\n\n\"Remind you of anyone, Tom?\" he says when I approach the two of them. He is not speaking of the little girl.\n\n\"Yes, Mister Rogers.\"\n\n\"Looks a bit like…_Old Rabbit_, doesn't it, Tom?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mister Rogers.\"\n\n\"I thought so.\"\n\nThen he turns back to the little girl. \"This man's name is Tom. When he was your age, he had a rabbit, too, and he loved it very much. Its name was Old Rabbit. What is yours named?\"\n\nThe little girl eyes me suspiciously, and then Mister Rogers. She goes a little knock-kneed, directs a thumb toward her mouth. \"Bunny Wunny,\" she says.\n\n\"Oh, that's a nice name,\" Mister Rogers says, and then goes to the Thirty-fourth Street escalator to climb it one last time for the cameras. When he reaches the street, he looks right at the lens, as he always does, and says, speaking of the Neighborhood, \"Let's go back to my place,\" and then makes a right turn toward Seventh Avenue, except that this time he just keeps going, and suddenly Margy Whitmer is saying, \"Where is Fred? Where is Fred?\" and Fred, he's a hundred yards away, in his sneakers and his purple sweater, and the only thing anyone sees of him is his gray head bobbing up and down amid all the other heads, the hundreds of them, the thousands, the millions, disappearing into the city and its swelter.\n\nEverett Collection\n\n___\n\nOnce upon a time, a little boy with a big sword went into battle against Mister Rogers. Or maybe, if the truth be told, Mister Rogers went into battle against a little boy with a big sword, for Mister Rogers didn't _like_ the big sword. It was one of those swords that really isn't a sword at all; it was a big plastic contraption with lights and sound effects, and it was the kind of sword used in defense of the universe by the heroes of the television shows that the little boy liked to watch. The little boy with the big sword did not watch Mister Rogers. In fact, the little boy with the big sword didn't know who Mister Rogers _was_, and so when Mister Rogers knelt down in front of him, the little boy with the big sword looked past him and through him, and when Mister Rogers said, \"Oh, my, that's a big sword you have,\" the boy didn't answer, and finally his mother got embarrassed and said, \"Oh, honey, c'mon, that's _Mister Rogers_,\" and felt his head for fever. Of course, she knew who Mister Rogers was, because she had grown up with him, and she knew that he was good for her son, and so now, with her little boy zombie-eyed under his blond bangs, she apologized, saying to Mister Rogers that she knew he was in a rush and that she knew he was here in Penn Station taping his program and that her son usually wasn't _like_ this, he was probably just tired…. Except that Mister Rogers wasn't going anywhere. Yes, sure, he was taping, and right there, in Penn Station in New York City, were rings of other children wiggling in wait for him, but right now his patient gray eyes were fixed on the little boy with the big sword, and so he stayed there, on one knee, until the little boy's eyes finally focused on Mister Rogers, and he said, \"It's not a sword; it's a death ray.\" A death ray! Oh, honey, Mommy _knew_ you could do it….And so now, encouraged, Mommy said, \"Do you want to give Mister Rogers a hug, honey?\" But the boy was shaking his head no, and Mister Rogers was sneaking his face past the big sword and the armor of the little boy's eyes and whispering something in his ear—something that, while not changing his mind about the hug, made the little boy look at Mister Rogers in a new way, with the eyes of a child at last, and nod his head yes.\n\nWe were heading back to his apartment in a taxi when I asked him what he had said.\n\n\"Oh, I just knew that whenever you see a little boy carrying something like that, it means that he wants to show people that he's strong on the outside. I just wanted to let him know that he was strong on the inside, too. And so that's what I told him. I said, 'Do you know that you're strong on the inside, too?' Maybe it was something he needed to hear.\"\n\n___\n\n\nHe was barely more than a boy himself when he learned what he would be fighting for, and fighting against, for the rest of his life. He was in college. He was a music major at a small school in Florida and planning to go to seminary upon graduation. His name was Fred Rogers. He came home to Latrobe, Pennsylvania, once upon a time, and his parents, because they were wealthy, had bought something new for the corner room of their big redbrick house. It was a television. Fred turned it on, and as he says now, with plaintive distaste, \"there were people throwing _pies_ at one another.\" He was the soft son of overprotective parents, but he believed, right then, that he was strong enough to enter into battle with _that_—that machine, that medium—and to wrestle with it until it yielded to him, until the ground touched by its blue shadow became hallowed and this thing called television came to be used \"for the broadcasting of grace through the land.\" It would not be easy, no—for in order to win such a battle, he would have to forbid himself the privilege of stopping, and whatever he did right he would have to repeat, as though he were already living in eternity. And so it was that the puppets he employed on _The Children's Corner_ would be the puppets he employed forty-four years later, and so it was that once he took off his jacket and his shoes…well, he was Mister Rogers for good. And even now, when he is producing only three weeks' worth of new programs a year, he still winds up agonizing—_agonizing_—about whether to announce his theme as \"Little and Big\" or \"Big and Little\" and still makes only two edits per televised minute, because he doesn't want his message to be determined by the cuts and splices in a piece of tape—to become, despite all his fierce coherence, \"a message of fragmentation.\"\n\n\u003e Though of all races, the schoolchildren were mostly black and Latino, and they didn't even approach Mister Rogers and ask him for his autograph. They just sang.\n\nHe is losing, of course. The revolution he started—a half hour a day, five days a week—it wasn't enough, it didn't _spread_, and so, forced to fight his battles alone, Mister Rogers is losing, as we all are losing. He is losing to it, to _our_ twenty-four-hour-a-day pie fight, to the dizzying cut and the disorienting edit, to the message of fragmentation, to the flicker and pulse and shudder and strobe, to the constant, hivey drone of the electroculture…and yet still he fights, deathly afraid that the medium he chose is consuming the very things he tried to protect: childhood and silence. Yes, at seventy years old and 143 pounds, Mister Rogers still fights, and indeed, early this year, when television handed him its highest honor, he responded by telling television—gently, of course—to just _shut up_ for once, and television listened. He had already won his third Daytime Emmy, and now he went onstage to accept Emmy's Lifetime Achievement Award, and there, in front of all the soap-opera stars and talk-show sinceratrons, in front of all the jutting man-tanned jaws and jutting saltwater bosoms, he made his small bow and said into the microphone, \"All of us have special ones who have loved us into being. Would you just take, along with me, _ten seconds_ to think of the people who have helped you become who you are….Ten seconds of silence.\" And then he lifted his wrist, and looked at the audience, and looked at his watch, and said softly, \"I'll watch the time,\" and there was, at first, a small whoop from the crowd, a giddy, strangled hiccup of laughter, as people realized that _he wasn't kidding_, that Mister Rogers was not some convenient eunuch but rather a _man_, an authority figure who actually expected them to do what he asked…and so they did. One second, two seconds, three seconds…and now the jaws clenched, and the bosoms heaved, and the mascara ran, and the tears fell upon the beglittered gathering like rain leaking down a crystal chandelier, and Mister Rogers finally looked up from his watch and said, \"May God be with you\" to all his vanquished children.\n\n___\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a little boy born blind, and so, defenseless in the world, he suffered the abuses of the defenseless, and when he grew up and became a man, he looked back and realized that he'd had no childhood at all, and that if he were ever to have a childhood, he would have to start having it now, in his forties. So the first thing he did was rechristen himself \"Joybubbles\"; the second thing he did was declare himself five years old forever; and the third thing he did was make a pilgrimage to Pittsburgh, where the University of Pittsburgh's Information Sciences Library keeps a Mister Rogers archive. It has all 865 programs, in both color and black and white, and for two months this past spring, Joybubbles went to the library every day for ten hours and watched the Neighborhood's every episode, plus specials—or, since he is blind, _listened_ to every episode, _imagined_ every episode. Until one night, Mister Rogers came to him, in what he calls a visitation—\"I was dreaming, but I was awake\"—and offered to teach him how to pray.\n\n\"But Mister Rogers, I can't pray,\" Joybubbles said, \"because every time I try to pray, I forget the words.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" Mister Rogers said, \"and that's why the prayer I'm going to teach you has only three words.\"\n\n\"What prayer is that, Mister Rogers? What kind of prayer has only three words?\"\n\n\"Thank you, God,\" Mister Rogers said.\n\n___\n\n\nThe walls of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood are light blue and fleeced with clouds. They are tall—as tall as the cinder-block walls they are designed to hide—and they encompass the Neighborhood's entire stage set, from the flimsy yellow house where Mister Rogers comes to visit, to the closet where he finds his sweaters, to the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, where he goes to dream. The blue walls are the ends of the daylit universe he has made, and yet Mister Rogers can't _see_ them—or at least can't know them—because he was born blind to color. He doesn't know the color of his walls, and one day, when I caught him looking toward his painted skies, I asked him to tell me what color they _are_, and he said, \"I imagine they're _blue_, Tom.\" Then he looked at me and smiled. \"I imagine they're blue.\"\n\n\u003e And yet still he fights, deathly afraid that the medium he chose is consuming the very things he tried to protect: childhood and silence.\n\nHe has spent thirty-one years imagining and reimagining those walls—the walls that have both penned him in and set him free. You would think it would be easy by now, being Mister Rogers; you would think that one morning he would wake up and think, Okay, all I have to do is be _nice_ for my allotted half hour today, and then I'll just take the rest of the day off….But no, Mister Rogers is a stubborn man, and so on the day I ask about the color of his sky, he has already gotten up at five-thirty, already prayed for those who have asked for his prayers, already read, already written, already swum, already weighed himself, already sent out cards for the birthdays he never forgets, already called any number of people who depend on him for comfort, already cried when he read the letter of a mother whose child was buried with a picture of Mister Rogers in his casket, already played for twenty minutes with an autistic boy who has come, with his father, all the way from Boise, Idaho, to meet him. The boy had never spoken, until one day he said, \"X the Owl,\" which is the name of one of Mister Rogers's puppets, and he had never looked his father in the eye until one day his father had said, \"Let's go to the Neighborhood of Make-Believe,\" and now the boy is speaking and reading, and the father has come to thank Mister Rogers for saving his son's life….And by this time, well, it's nine-thirty in the morning, time for Mister Rogers to take off his jacket and his shoes and put on his sweater and his sneakers and start taping another visit to the Neighborhood. He writes all his own scripts, but on this day, when he receives a visit from Mrs. McFeely and a springer spaniel, she says that she has to bring the dog \"back to his owner,\" and Mister Rogers makes a face. The cameras stop, and he says, \"I don't like the word owner there. It's not a good word. Let's change it to 'bring the dog _home_.'\" And so the change is made, and the taping resumes, and this is how it goes all day, a life unfolding within a clasp of unfathomable governance, and once, when I lose sight of him, I ask Margy Whitmer where he is, and she says, \"Right over your shoulder, where he always is,\" and when I turn around, Mister Rogers is facing me, child-stealthy, with a small black camera in his hand, to take another picture for the album that he will give me when I take my leave of him.\n\nYes, it should be easy being Mister Rogers, but when four o'clock rolls around, well, Mister Rogers is _tired_, and so he sneaks over to the piano and starts playing, with dexterous, pale fingers, the music that used to end a 1940s newsreel and that has now become the music he plays to signal to the cast and crew that a day's taping has wrapped. On this day, however, he is premature by a considerable extent, and so Margy, who has been with Mister Rogers since 1983—because nobody who works for Mister Rogers ever _leaves_ the Neighborhood—comes running over, papers in hand, and says, \"Not so fast there, buster.\"\n\n\"Oh, please, sister,\" Mister Rogers says. \"I'm done.\"\n\nAnd now Margy comes up behind him and massages his shoulders. \"No, you're not,\" she says. \"Roy Rogers is done. Mister Rogers still has a ways to go.\"\n\n___\nHe was a child, once, too, and so one day I asked him if I could go with him back to Latrobe. He thought about it for a second, then said, by way of agreement, \"Okay, then—tomorrow, Tom, I'll show you childhood.\" Not _his_ childhood, mind you, or even _a_ childhood—no, just \"childhood.\" And so the next morning, we swam together, and then he put on his boxer shorts and the dark socks, and the T-shirt, and the gray trousers, and the belt, and then the white dress shirt and the black bow tie and the gray suit jacket, and about two hours later we were pulling up to the big brick house on Weldon Street in Latrobe, and Mister Rogers was thinking about going inside.\n\nThere was nobody home. The doors were open, unlocked, because the house was undergoing a renovation of some kind, but the owners were away, and Mister Rogers's boyhood home was empty of everyone but workmen. \"Do you think we can go in?\" he asked Bill Isler, president of Family Communications, the company that produces _Mister Rogers' Neighborhood_. Bill had driven us there, and now, sitting behind the wheel of his red Grand Cherokee, he was full of remonstrance. \"No!\" he said. \"Fred, they're _not home_. If we wanted to go into the house, we should have _called_ first. Fred…\" But Mister Rogers was out of the car, with his camera in his hand and his legs moving so fast that the material of his gray suit pants furled and unfurled around both of his skinny legs, like flags exploding in a breeze. And here, as he made his way through thickets of bewildered workmen—this skinny old man dressed in a gray suit and a bow tie, with his hands on his hips and his arms akimbo, like a dance instructor—there was some kind of wiggly jazz in his legs, and he went flying all around the outside of the house, pointing at windows, saying there was the room where he learned to play the piano, and there was the room where he saw the pie fight on a primitive television, and there was the room where his beloved father died…until finally we reached the front door. He put his hand on the knob; he cracked it open, but then, with Bill Isler calling caution from the car, he said, \"Maybe we _shouldn't_ go in. And all the people who made this house special to me are not here, anyway. They're all in heaven.\"\n\nAnd so we went to the graveyard. We were heading there all along, because Mister Rogers _loves_ graveyards, and so as we took the long, straight road out of sad, fading Latrobe, you could still feel the _speed_ in him, the hurry, as he mustered up a sad anticipation, and when we passed through the cemetery gates, he smiled as he said to Bill Isler, \"The plot's at the end of the yellow-brick road.\" And so it was; the asphalt ended, and then we began bouncing over a road of old blond bricks, until even that road ended, and we were parked in front of the place where Mister Rogers is to be buried. He got out of the car, and, moving as quickly as he had moved to the door of his house, he stepped up a small hill to the door of a large gray mausoleum, a huge structure built for six, with a slightly peaked roof, and bronze doors, and angels living in the stained glass. He peeked in the window, and in the same voice he uses on television, _that_ voice, at once so patient and so eager, he pointed out each crypt, saying \"There's my father, and there's my mother, and there, on the left, is my place, and right across will be Joanne....\" The window was of darkened glass, though, and so to see through it, we had to press our faces close against it, and where the glass had warped away from the frame of the door—where there was a finger-wide crack—Mister Rogers's voice leaked into his grave, and came back to us as a soft, hollow echo.\n\nAnd then he was on the move again, happily, quickly, for he would not leave until he showed me all the places of all those who'd loved him into being. His grandfather, his grandmother, his uncles, his aunts, his father-in-law and mother-in-law, even his family's servants—he went to each grave, and spoke their names, and told their stories, until finally I headed back down to the Jeep and turned back around to see Mister Rogers standing high on a green dell, smiling among the stones. \"And now if you don't mind,\" he said without a hint of shame or embarrassment, \"I have to find a place to relieve myself,\" and then off he went, this ecstatic ascetic, to take a proud piss in his corner of heaven.\n\n___\n\nOnce upon a time, a man named Fred Rogers decided that he wanted to live in heaven. Heaven is the place where good people go when they die, but this man, Fred Rogers, didn't want to _go_ to heaven; he wanted to _live_ in heaven, here, now, in this world, and so one day, when he was talking about all the people he had loved in this life, he looked at me and said, \"The connections we make in the course of a life—maybe that's what heaven is, Tom. We make so _many_ connections here on earth. Look at us—I've just met you, but I'm investing in who you are and who you will be, and I can't help it.\"\n\n\u003e \"Look at us—I've just met you, but I'm investing in who you are and who you will be, and I can't help it.\"\n\nThe next afternoon, I went to his office in Pittsburgh. He was sitting on a couch, under a framed rendering of the Greek word for grace and a biblical phrase written in Hebrew that means \"I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine.\" A woman was with him, sitting in a big chair. Her name was Deb. She was very pretty. She had a long face and a dark blush to her skin. She had curls in her hair and stars at the centers of her eyes. She was a minister at Fred Rogers's church. She spent much of her time tending to the sick and the dying. Fred Rogers loved her very much, and so, out of nowhere, he smiled and put his hand over hers. \"Will you be with me when I die?\" he asked her, and when she said yes, he said, \"Oh, thank you, my dear.\" Then, with his hand still over hers and his eyes looking straight into hers, he said, \"Deb, do you know what a great prayer you are? Do you know that about yourself? Your prayers are just wonderful.\" Then he looked at me. I was sitting in a small chair by the door, and he said, \"Tom, would you close the door, please?\" I closed the door and sat back down. \"Thanks, my dear,\" he said to me, then turned back to Deb. \"Now, Deb, I'd like to ask you a favor,\" he said. \"Would you lead us? Would you lead us in prayer?\"\n\nDeb stiffened for a second, and she let out a breath, and her color got deeper. \"Oh, I don't know, Fred,\" she said. \"I don't know if I want to put on a _performance_….\"\n\nFred never stopped looking at her or let go of her hand. \"It's not a performance. It's just a meeting of friends,\" he said. He moved his hand from her wrist to her palm and extended his other hand to me. I took it and then put my hand around her free hand. His hand was warm, hers was cool, and we bowed our heads, and closed our eyes, and I heard Deb's voice calling out for the grace of God. What is grace? I'm not certain; all I know is that my heart felt like a spike, and then, in that room, it opened and felt like an umbrella. I had never prayed like that before, ever. I had always been a great prayer, a powerful one, but only fitfully, only out of guilt, only when fear and desperation drove me to it…and it hit me, right then, with my eyes closed, that this was the moment Fred Rogers—Mister Rogers—had been leading me to from the moment he answered the door of his apartment in his bathrobe and asked me about Old Rabbit. Once upon a time, you see, I lost something, and prayed to get it back, but when I lost it the second time, I didn't, and now this was it, the missing word, the unuttered promise, the prayer I'd been waiting to say a very long time.\n\n\"Thank you, God,\" Mister Rogers said.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":["fave","inspiration","archive","external"]},"/meta/external/Expert-on-Mental-Illness-Reveals-Her-Own-Struggle-The-New-York-Times":{"title":"Expert on Mental Illness Reveals Her Own Struggle - The New York Times","content":"\n# Expert on Mental Illness Reveals Her Own Struggle - The New York Times\n\n---\nLives Restored\n\n-   June 23, 2011\n\nHARTFORD — Are you one of us?\n\nThe patient wanted to know, and her therapist — Marsha M. Linehan of the University of Washington, creator of a treatment used worldwide for severely suicidal people — had a ready answer. It was the one she always used to cut the question short, whether a patient asked it hopefully, accusingly or knowingly, having glimpsed the macramé of faded burns, cuts and welts on Dr. Linehan’s arms:\n\n“You mean, have I suffered?”\n\n“No, Marsha,” the patient replied, in an encounter last spring. “I mean one of us. Like us. Because if you were, it would give all of us so much hope.”\n\n“That did it,” said [Dr. Linehan](http://www.depts.washington.edu/brtc \"http://www.depts.washington.edu/brtc\"), 68, who told her story in public for the first time last week before an audience of friends, family and doctors at the [Institute of Living](http://www.harthosp.org/InstituteOfLiving/default.aspx \"Web site\"), the Hartford clinic where she was first treated for extreme social withdrawal at age 17. “So many people have begged me to come forward, and I just thought — well, I have to do this. I owe it to them. I cannot die a coward.”\n\nNo one knows how many people with severe mental illness live what appear to be normal, successful lives, because such people are not in the habit of announcing themselves. They are too busy juggling responsibilities, paying the bills, studying, raising families — all while weathering gusts of dark emotions or delusions that would quickly overwhelm almost anyone else.\n\nNow, an increasing number of them are risking exposure of their secret, saying that the time is right. The nation’s mental health system is a shambles, they say, criminalizing many patients and warehousing some of the most severe in nursing and group homes where they receive care from workers with minimal qualifications.\n\nMoreover, the enduring stigma of mental illness teaches people with such a diagnosis to think of themselves as victims, snuffing out the one thing that can motivate them to find treatment: hope.\n\n“There’s a tremendous need to implode the myths of mental illness, to put a face on it, to show people that a diagnosis does not have to lead to a painful and oblique life,” said Elyn R. Saks, a professor at the University of Southern California School of Law who chronicles her own struggles with schizophrenia in “The Center Cannot Hold: My Journey Through Madness.” “We who struggle with these disorders can lead full, happy, productive lives, if we have the right resources.”\n\nThese include medication (usually), therapy (often), a measure of good luck (always) — and, most of all, the inner strength to manage one’s demons, if not banish them. That strength can come from any number of places, these former patients say: love, forgiveness, faith in God, a lifelong friendship.\n\nBut Dr. Linehan’s case shows there is no recipe. She was driven by a mission to rescue people who are chronically suicidal, often as a result of borderline personality disorder, an enigmatic condition characterized in part by self-destructive urges.\n\n“I honestly didn’t realize at the time that I was dealing with myself,” she said. “But I suppose it’s true that I developed a therapy that provides the things I needed for so many years and never got.”\n\n**‘I Was in Hell’**\n\nShe learned the central tragedy of severe mental illness the hard way, banging her head against the wall of a locked room.\n\nMarsha Linehan arrived at the Institute of Living on March 9, 1961, at age 17, and quickly became the sole occupant of the seclusion room on the unit known as Thompson Two, for the most severely ill patients. The staff saw no alternative: The girl attacked herself habitually, burning her wrists with cigarettes, slashing her arms, her legs, her midsection, using any sharp object she could get her hands on.\n\nThe seclusion room, a small cell with a bed, a chair and a tiny, barred window, had no such weapon. Yet her urge to die only deepened. So she did the only thing that made any sense to her at the time: banged her head against the wall and, later, the floor. Hard.\n\n“My whole experience of these episodes was that someone else was doing it; it was like ‘I know this is coming, I’m out of control, somebody help me; where are you, God?’ ” she said. “I felt totally empty, like the Tin Man; I had no way to communicate what was going on, no way to understand it.”\n\nImage![\u0026#8220;So many people have begged me to come forward, and I just thought \u0026#8212; well, I have to do this.

An excellent student from early on, a natural on the piano, she was the third of six children of an oilman and his wife, an outgoing woman who juggled child care with the Junior League and Tulsa social events.\n\nPeople who knew the Linehans at that time remember that their precocious third child was often in trouble at home, and Dr. Linehan recalls feeling deeply inadequate compared with her attractive and accomplished siblings. But whatever currents of distress ran under the surface, no one took much notice until she was bedridden with headaches in her senior year of high school.\n\nHer younger sister, Aline Haynes, said: “This was Tulsa in the 1960s, and I don’t think my parents had any idea what to do with Marsha. No one really knew what mental illness was.”\n\nSoon, a local psychiatrist recommended a stay at the Institute of Living, to get to the bottom of the problem. There, doctors gave her a diagnosis of schizophrenia; dosed her with [Thorazine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000553/ \"National Institutes of Health Web page on Thorazine\"), [Librium](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000568/ \"National Institutes of Health Web Page on Librium (Chlordiazepoxide)\") and other powerful drugs, as well as hours of Freudian analysis; and strapped her down for electroshock treatments, 14 shocks the first time through and 16 the second, according to her medical records. Nothing changed, and soon enough the patient was back in seclusion on the locked ward.\n\n“Everyone was terrified of ending up in there,” said Sebern Fisher, a fellow patient who became a close friend. But whatever her surroundings, Ms. Fisher added, “Marsha was capable of caring a great deal about another person; her passion was as deep as her loneliness.”\n\nA discharge summary, dated May 31, 1963, noted that “during 26 months of hospitalization, Miss Linehan was, for a considerable part of this time, one of the most disturbed patients in the hospital.”\n\nA verse the troubled girl wrote at the time reads:\n\nThey put me in a four-walled room\n\nBut left me really out\n\nMy soul was tossed somewhere askew\n\nMy limbs were tossed here about\n\nBang her head where she would, the tragedy remained: no one knew what was happening to her, and as a result medical care only made it worse. Any real treatment would have to be based not on some theory, she later concluded, but on facts: which precise emotion led to which thought led to the latest gruesome act. It would have to break that chain — and teach a new behavior.\n\n“I was in hell,” she said. “And I made a vow: when I get out, I’m going to come back and get others out of here.”\n\n**Radical Acceptance**\n\nShe sensed the power of another principle while praying in a small chapel in Chicago.\n\nIt was 1967, several years after she left the institute as a desperate 20-year-old whom doctors gave little chance of surviving outside the hospital. Survive she did, barely: there was at least one suicide attempt in Tulsa, when she first arrived home; and another episode after she moved to a Y.M.C.A. in Chicago to start over.\n\nShe was hospitalized again and emerged confused, lonely and more committed than ever to her Catholic faith. She moved into another Y, found a job as a clerk in an insurance company, started taking night classes at Loyola University — and prayed, often, at a chapel in the Cenacle Retreat Center.\n\n“One night I was kneeling in there, looking up at the cross, and the whole place became gold — and suddenly I felt something coming toward me,” she said. “It was this shimmering experience, and I just ran back to my room and said, ‘I love myself.’ It was the first time I remember talking to myself in the first person. I felt transformed.”\n\nThe high lasted about a year, before the feelings of devastation returned in the wake of a romance that ended. But something was different. She could now weather her emotional storms without cutting or harming herself.\n\nImage\n\n![The door to the room where as a teenager Dr. Linehan was put in seclusion.

On the surface, it seemed obvious: She had accepted herself as she was. She had tried to kill herself so many times because the gulf between the person she wanted to be and the person she was left her desperate, hopeless, deeply homesick for a life she would never know. That gulf was real, and unbridgeable.\n\nThat basic idea — radical acceptance, she now calls it — became increasingly important as she began working with patients, first at a suicide clinic in Buffalo and later as a researcher. Yes, real change was possible. The emerging discipline of behaviorism taught that people could learn new behaviors — and that acting differently can in time alter underlying emotions from the top down.\n\nBut deeply suicidal people have tried to change a million times and failed. The only way to get through to them was to acknowledge that their behavior made sense: Thoughts of death were sweet release given what they were suffering.\n\n“She was very creative with people. I saw that right away,” said Gerald C. Davison, who in 1972 admitted Dr. Linehan into a postdoctoral program in behavioral therapy at Stony Brook University. (He is now a psychologist at the University of Southern California.) “She could get people off center, challenge them with things they didn’t want to hear without making them feel put down.”\n\nNo therapist could promise a quick transformation or even sudden “insight,” much less a shimmering religious vision. But now Dr. Linehan was closing in on two seemingly opposed principles that could form the basis of a treatment: acceptance of life as it is, not as it is supposed to be; and the need to change, despite that reality and because of it. The only way to know for sure whether she had something more than a theory was to test it scientifically in the real world — and there was never any doubt where to start.\n\n**Getting Through the Day**\n\n“I decided to get supersuicidal people, the very worst cases, because I figured these are the most miserable people in the world — they think they’re evil, that they’re bad, bad, bad — and I understood that they weren’t,” she said. “I understood their suffering because I’d been there, in hell, with no idea how to get out.”\n\nIn particular she chose to treat people with a diagnosis that she would have given her young self: borderline personality disorder, a poorly understood condition characterized by neediness, outbursts and self-destructive urges, often leading to cutting or burning. In therapy, borderline patients can be terrors — manipulative, hostile, sometimes ominously mute, and notorious for storming out threatening suicide.\n\nDr. Linehan found that the tension of acceptance could at least keep people in the room: patients accept who they are, that they feel the mental squalls of rage, emptiness and anxiety far more intensely than most people do. In turn, the therapist accepts that given all this, cutting, burning and suicide attempts make some sense.\n\nFinally, the therapist elicits a commitment from the patient to change his or her behavior, a verbal pledge in exchange for a chance to live: “Therapy does not work for people who are dead” is one way she puts it.\n\nYet even as she climbed the academic ladder, moving from the Catholic University of America to the University of Washington in 1977, she understood from her own experience that acceptance and change were hardly enough. During those first years in Seattle she sometimes felt suicidal while driving to work; even today, she can feel rushes of panic, most recently while driving through tunnels. She relied on therapists herself, off and on over the years, for support and guidance (she does not remember taking medication after leaving the institute).\n\nDr. Linehan’s own emerging approach to treatment — now called dialectical behavior therapy, or D.B.T. — would also have to include day-to-day skills. A commitment means very little, after all, if people do not have the tools to carry it out. She borrowed some of these from other behavioral therapies and added elements, like opposite action, in which patients act opposite to the way they feel when an emotion is inappropriate; and mindfulness meditation, a Zen technique in which people focus on their breath and observe their emotions come and go without acting on them. (Mindfulness is now a staple of many kinds of psychotherapy.)\n\nIn studies in the 1980s and ’90s, researchers at the University of Washington and elsewhere tracked the progress of hundreds of borderline patients at high risk of suicide who attended weekly dialectical therapy sessions. Compared with similar patients who got other experts’ treatments, those who learned Dr. Linehan’s approach made far fewer suicide attempts, landed in the hospital less often and were much more likely to stay in treatment. D.B.T. is now widely used for a variety of stubborn clients, including juvenile offenders, people with eating disorders and those with drug addictions.\n\n“I think the reason D.B.T. has made such a splash is that it addresses something that couldn’t be treated before; people were just at a loss when it came to borderline,” said Lisa Onken, chief of the behavioral and integrative treatment branch of the National Institutes of Health. “But I think the reason it has resonated so much with community therapists has a lot to do with Marsha Linehan’s charisma, her ability to connect with clinical people as well as a scientific audience.”\n\nMost remarkably, perhaps, Dr. Linehan has reached a place where she can stand up and tell her story, come what will. “I’m a very happy person now,” she said in an interview at her house near campus, where she lives with her adopted daughter, Geraldine, and Geraldine’s husband, Nate. “I still have ups and downs, of course, but I think no more than anyone else.”\n\nAfter her coming-out speech last week, she visited the seclusion room, which has since been converted to a small office. “Well, look at that, they changed the windows,” she said, holding her palms up. “There’s so much more light.”\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":["psychology","archive","fave"]},"/meta/external/Fatal-Distraction-Forgetting-a-Child-in-the-Backseat-of-a-Car-Is-a-Horrifying-Mistake.-Is-It-a-Crime-The-Washington-Post":{"title":"Fatal Distraction: Forgetting a Child in the Backseat of a Car Is a Horrifying Mistake.

(The Washington Post) \n\nThe defendant was an immense man, well over 300 pounds, but in the gravity of his sorrow and shame he seemed larger still. He hunched forward in the sturdy wooden armchair that barely contained him, sobbing softly into tissue after tissue, a leg bouncing nervously under the table. In the first pew of spectators sat his wife, looking stricken, absently twisting her wedding band. The room was a sepulcher. Witnesses spoke softly of events so painful that many lost their composure. When a hospital emergency room nurse described how the defendant had behaved after the police first brought him in, she wept. He was virtually catatonic, she remembered, his eyes shut tight, rocking back and forth, locked away in some unfathomable private torment. He would not speak at all for the longest time, not until the nurse sank down beside him and held his hand. It was only then that the patient began to open up, and what he said was that he didn’t want any sedation, that he didn’t deserve a respite from pain, that he wanted to feel it all, and then to die.\n\nThe charge in the courtroom was manslaughter, brought by the Commonwealth of Virginia. No significant facts were in dispute. Miles Harrison, 49, was an amiable person, a diligent businessman and a doting, conscientious father until the day last summer -- beset by problems at work, making call after call on his cellphone -- he forgot to drop his son, Chase, at day care. The toddler slowly sweltered to death, strapped into a car seat for nearly nine hours in an office parking lot in Herndon in the blistering heat of July.\n\nIt was an inexplicable, inexcusable mistake, but was it a crime? That was the question for a judge to decide.\n\nAt one point, during a recess, Harrison rose unsteadily to his feet, turned to leave the courtroom and saw, as if for the first time, that there were people witnessing his disgrace. The big man’s eyes lowered. He swayed a little until someone steadied him, and then he gasped out in a keening falsetto: “My poor baby!”\n\nA group of middle-schoolers filed into the room for a scheduled class trip to the courthouse. The teacher clearly hadn’t expected this; within a few minutes, the wide-eyed kids were hustled back out.\n\n![](https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/06/16/Magazine/Images/49AD684C0000000A514FB0D3.jpg?uuid=BKqCQvWJEeOmBpRv1jL58Q) Miles Harrison holds a toy that belonged to his son, Chase, who died after being left in the back seat of his father's car last summer. (Copyright Rebecca Drobis) \n\nThe trial would last three days. Sitting through it, side by side in the rear of the courtroom, were two women who had traveled hours to get there. Unlike almost everyone else on the spectator benches, they were not relatives or co-workers or close friends of the accused.\n\n“. . . the lower portion of the body was red to red-purple. . .”\n\nAs the most excruciating of the evidence came out, from the medical examiner, the women in the back drew closer together, leaning in to each other.\n\n“ . . . a green discoloration of the abdomen . . . autolysis of the organs . . . what we call skin slippage . . . the core body temperature reaches 108 degrees when death ensues.”\n\nMary -- the older, shorter one -- trembled. Lyn -- the younger, taller one with the long, strawberry-blond hair -- gathered her in, one arm around the shoulder, the other across their bodies, holding hands.\n\nWhen the trial ended, Lyn Balfour and Mary Parks left quietly, drawing no attention to themselves. They hadn’t wanted to be there, but they’d felt a duty, both to the defendant and, in a much more complicated way, to themselves.\n\nIt was unusual, to say the least: three people together in one place, sharing the same heartbreaking history. All three had accidentally killed their babies in the identical, incomprehensible, modern way.\n\nIn 2013, 43 children died from vehicle-induced heat stroke. As summer temperatures rise, here are a few simple tips from the National Safety Council to keep kids safe. (Tom LeGro/The Washington Post) \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“Death by hyperthermia” is the official designation. When it happens to young children, the facts are often the same: An otherwise loving and attentive parent one day gets busy, or distracted, or upset, or confused by a change in his or her daily routine, and just... forgets a child is in the car. It happens that way somewhere in the United States 15 to 25 times a year, parceled out through the spring, summer and early fall. The season is almost upon us.\n\nTwo decades ago, this was relatively rare. But in the early 1990s, car-safety experts declared that passenger-side front airbags could kill children, and they recommended that child seats be moved to the back of the car; then, for even more safety for the very young, that the baby seats be pivoted to face the rear. If few foresaw the tragic consequence of the lessened visibility of the child . . . well, who can blame them? What kind of person forgets a baby?\n\nThe wealthy do, it turns out. And the poor, and the middle class. Parents of all ages and ethnicities do it. Mothers are just as likely to do it as fathers. It happens to the chronically absent-minded and to the fanatically organized, to the college-educated and to the marginally literate. In the last 10 years, it has happened to a dentist. A postal clerk. A social worker. A police officer. An accountant. A soldier. A paralegal. An electrician. A Protestant clergyman. A rabbinical student. A nurse. A construction worker. An assistant principal. It happened to a mental health counselor, a college professor and a pizza chef. It happened to a pediatrician. It happened to a rocket scientist.\n\nLast year it happened three times in one day, the worst day so far in the worst year so far in a phenomenon that gives no sign of abating.\n\nThe facts in each case differ a little, but always there is the terrible moment when the parent realizes what he or she has done, often through a phone call from a spouse or caregiver. This is followed by a frantic sprint to the car. What awaits there is the worst thing in the world.\n\nEach instance has its own macabre signature. One father had parked his car next to the grounds of a county fair; as he discovered his son’s body, a calliope tootled merrily beside him. Another man, wanting to end things quickly, tried to wrestle a gun from a police officer at the scene. Several people -- including Mary Parks of Blacksburg -- have driven from their workplace to the day-care center to pick up the child they’d thought they’d dropped off, never noticing the corpse in the back seat.\n\nThen there is the Chattanooga, Tenn., business executive who must live with this: His motion-detector car alarm went off, three separate times, out there in the broiling sun. But when he looked out, he couldn’t see anyone tampering with the car. So he remotely deactivated the alarm and went calmly back to work.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThere may be no act of human failing that more fundamentally challenges our society’s views about crime, punishment, justice and mercy. According to statistics compiled by a national childs’ safety advocacy group, in about 40 percent of cases authorities examine the evidence, determine that the child’s death was a terrible accident -- a mistake of memory that delivers a lifelong sentence of guilt far greater than any a judge or jury could mete out -- and file no charges. In the other 60 percent of the cases, parsing essentially identical facts and applying them to essentially identical laws, authorities decide that the negligence was so great and the injury so grievous that it must be called a felony, and it must be aggressively pursued.\n\nAs it happens, just five days before Miles Harrison forgot his toddler son in the parking lot of the Herndon corporate-relocation business where he worked, a similar event had occurred a few hundred miles southeast. After a long shift at work, a Portsmouth, Va., sanitation department electrician named Andrew Culpepper picked up his toddler son from his parents, drove home, went into the house and then fell asleep, forgetting he’d had the boy in the car, leaving him to bake to death outside his home.\n\nHarrison was charged with a crime. Culpepper was not. In each case, the decision fell to one person.\n\nWith Harrison, it was Ray Morrogh, the Fairfax commonwealth’s attorney. In an interview a few days after he brought the charge of involuntary manslaughter, Morrogh explained why.\n\n“There is a lot to be said for reaffirming people’s obligations to protect their children,” he said. “When you have children, you have responsibilities. I am very strong in the defense of children’s safety.”\n\nMorrogh has two kids himself, ages 12 and 14\\. He was asked if he could imagine this ever having happened to him. The question seemed to take him aback. He went on to another subject, and then, 10 minutes later, made up his mind:\n\n“I have to say no, it couldn’t have happened to me. I am a watchful father.”\n\nIn Portsmouth, the decision not to charge Culpepper, 40, was made by Commonwealth’s Attorney Earle Mobley. As tragic as the child’s death was, Mobley says, a police investigation showed that there was no crime because there was no intent; Culpepper wasn’t callously gambling with the child’s life -- he had forgotten the child was there.\n\n“The easy thing in a case like this is to dump it on a jury, but that is not the right thing to do,” Mobley says. A prosecutor’s responsibility, he says, is to achieve justice, not to settle some sort of score.\n\n“I’m not pretty sure I made the right decision,” he says. “I’m positive I made the right decision.”\n\nThere may be no clear right or wrong in deciding how to handle cases such as these; in each case, a public servant is trying to do his best with a Solomonic dilemma. But public servants are also human beings, and they will inevitably bring to their judgment the full weight of that complicated fact.\n\n“You know, it’s interesting we’re talking today,” Mobley says.\n\nHe has five children. Today, he says, is the birthday of his sixth.\n\n“She died of leukemia in 1993\\. She was almost 3.”\n\nMobley pauses. He doesn’t want to create the wrong impression.\n\nHe made the decision on the law, he says, “but I also have some idea what it feels like, what it does to you, when you lose a child.”\n\nSo, after his son’s death, Andrew Culpepper was sent home to try to live the remainder of his life with what he had done. After his son’s death, Miles Harrison was charged with a felony. His mug shot was in the newspapers and on TV, with the haunted, hunted, naked-eyed look these parents always have, up against the wall. He hired an expensive lawyer. Over months, both sides developed their cases. Witnesses were assembled and interviewed. Efforts at a plea bargain failed. The trial began.\n\nThe court heard how Harrison and his wife had been a late-40s childless couple desperately wanting to become parents, and how they’d made three visits to Moscow, setting out each time on a grueling 10-hour railroad trip to the Russian hinterlands to find and adopt their 18-month-old son from an orphanage bed he’d seldom been allowed to leave. Harrison’s next-door neighbor testified how she’d watched the new father giddily frolic on the lawn with his son. Harrison’s sister testified how she had worked with her brother and sister-in-law for weeks to find the ideal day-care situation for the boy, who would need special attention to recover from the effects of his painfully austere beginnings.\n\nFrom the witness stand, Harrison’s mother defiantly declared that Miles had been a fine son and a perfect, loving father. Distraught but composed, Harrison’s wife, Carol, described the phone call that her husband had made to her right after he’d discovered what he’d done, the phone call she’d fielded on a bus coming home from work. It was, she said, unintelligible screaming.\n\nIn the end, Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge R. Terence Ney found Miles Harrison not guilty. There was no crime, he said, citing the identical legal reasons Earle Mobley had cited for not charging Andrew Culpepper in the first place.\n\nAt the verdict, Harrison gasped, sobbed, then tried to stand, but the man had nothing left. His legs buckled, and he crashed pathetically to his knees.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo, if it’s not manslaughter, what is it? An accident?\n\n“No, that’s an imperfect word.”\n\nThis is Mark Warschauer, an internationally acclaimed expert in language learning and technology, professor of education at the University of California at Irvine.\n\n“The word ‘accident’ makes it sound like it can’t be prevented,” Warschauer says, “but ‘incident’ makes it sound trivial. And it is not trivial.”\n\nWarschauer is a Fulbright scholar, specializing in the use of laptops to spread literacy to children. In the summer of 2003, he returned to his office from lunch to find a crowd surrounding a car in the parking lot. Police had smashed the window open with a crowbar. Only as he got closer did Warschauer realize it was his car. That was his first clue that he’d forgotten to drop his 10-month-old son, Mikey, at day care that morning. Mikey was dead.\n\nWarschauer wasn’t charged with a crime, but for months afterward he contemplated suicide. Gradually, he says, the urge subsided, if not the grief and guilt.\n\n“We lack a term for what this is,” Warschauer says. And also, he says, we need an understanding of why it happens to the people it happens to.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDavid Diamond is picking at his breakfast at a Washington hotel, trying to explain.\n\n“Memory is a machine,” he says, “and it is not flawless. Our conscious mind prioritizes things by importance, but on a cellular level, our memory does not. If you’re capable of forgetting your cellphone, you are potentially capable of forgetting your child.”\n\nDiamond is a professor of molecular physiology at the University of South Florida and a consultant to the veterans hospital in Tampa. He’s here for a national science conference to give a speech about his research, which involves the intersection of emotion, stress and memory. What he’s found is that under some circumstances, the most sophisticated part of our thought-processing center can be held hostage to a competing memory system, a primitive portion of the brain that is -- by a design as old as the dinosaur’s -- inattentive, pigheaded, nonanalytical, stupid.\n\nDiamond is the memory expert with a lousy memory, the one who recently realized, while driving to the mall, that his infant granddaughter was asleep in the back of the car. He remembered only because his wife, sitting beside him, mentioned the baby. He understands what could have happened had he been alone with the child. Almost worse, he understands exactly why.\n\nThe human brain, he says, is a magnificent but jury-rigged device in which newer and more sophisticated structures sit atop a junk heap of prototype brains still used by lower species. At the top of the device are the smartest and most nimble parts: the prefrontal cortex, which thinks and analyzes, and the hippocampus, which makes and holds on to our immediate memories. At the bottom is the basal ganglia, nearly identical to the brains of lizards, controlling voluntary but barely conscious actions.\n\nDiamond says that in situations involving familiar, routine motor skills, the human animal presses the basal ganglia into service as a sort of auxiliary autopilot. When our prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are planning our day on the way to work, the ignorant but efficient basal ganglia is operating the car; that’s why you’ll sometimes find yourself having driven from point A to point B without a clear recollection of the route you took, the turns you made or the scenery you saw.\n\nOrdinarily, says Diamond, this delegation of duty “works beautifully, like a symphony. But sometimes, it turns into the ‘1812 Overture.’ The cannons take over and overwhelm.”\n\nBy experimentally exposing rats to the presence of cats, and then recording electrochemical changes in the rodents’ brains, Diamond has found that stress -- either sudden or chronic -- can weaken the brain’s higher-functioning centers, making them more susceptible to bullying from the basal ganglia. He’s seen the same sort of thing play out in cases he’s followed involving infant deaths in cars.\n\n“The quality of prior parental care seems to be irrelevant,” he said. “The important factors that keep showing up involve a combination of stress, emotion, lack of sleep and change in routine, where the basal ganglia is trying to do what it’s supposed to do, and the conscious mind is too weakened to resist. What happens is that the memory circuits in a vulnerable hippocampus literally get overwritten, like with a computer program. Unless the memory circuit is rebooted -- such as if the child cries, or, you know, if the wife mentions the child in the back -- it can entirely disappear.”\n\nDiamond stops.\n\n“There is a case in Virginia where this is exactly what happened, the whole set of stress factors. I was consulted on it a couple of years ago. It was a woman named, ah . . .”\n\nHe puts down his fork, searches the ceiling, the wall, the floor, then shakes his head. He’s been stressing over his conference speech, he says, and his memory retrieval is shot. He can’t summon the name.\n\nLyn Balfour?\n\n“Yeah, Lyn Balfour! The perfect storm.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt’s mid-October. Lyn Balfour is on her cellphone, ordering a replacement strap for a bouncy seat for the new baby and simultaneously trying to arrange for an emergency sitter, because she has to get to the fertility clinic, pronto, because she just got lab results back, and she’s ovulating, and her husband’s in Iraq, and she wants to get artificially inseminated with his sperm, like right now, but, crap, the sitter is busy, so she grabs the kid and the keys and the diaper bag and is out the door and in the car and gone. But now the baby is fussing, so she’s reaching back to give him a bottle of juice, one eye on him and the other on a seemingly endless series of hairpin turns that she negotiates adroitly.\n\n“Actually,” she laughs, “I’m getting better about not doing too much at once. I’ve been simplifying my life a lot.”\n\nRaelyn Balfour is what is commonly called a type-A personality. She is the first to admit that her temperament contributed to the death of her son, Bryce, two years ago. It happened on March 30, 2007, the day she accidentally left the 9-month-old in the parking lot of the Charlottesville judge advocate general’s office, where she worked as a transportation administrator. The high temperature that day was only in the 60s, but the biometrics and thermodynamics of babies and cars combine mercilessly: Young children have lousy thermostats, and heat builds quickly in a closed vehicle in the sun. The temperature in Balfour’s car that day topped 110 degrees.\n\nThere’s a dismayingly cartoonish expression for what happened to Lyn Balfour on March 30, 2007\\. British psychologist James Reason coined the term the “Swiss Cheese Model” in 1990 to explain through analogy why catastrophic failures can occur in organizations despite multiple layers of defense. Reason likens the layers to slices of Swiss cheese, piled upon each other, five or six deep. The holes represent small, potentially insignificant weaknesses. Things will totally collapse only rarely, he says, but when they do, it is by coincidence -- when all the holes happen to align so that there is a breach through the entire system.\n\nOn the day Balfour forgot Bryce in the car, she had been up much of the night, first babysitting for a friend who had to take her dog to an emergency vet clinic, then caring for Bryce, who was cranky with a cold. Because the baby was also tired, he uncharacteristically dozed in the car, so he made no noise. Because Balfour was planning to bring Bryce’s usual car seat to the fire station to be professionally installed, Bryce was positioned in a different car seat that day, not behind the passenger but behind the driver, and was thus not visible in the rear-view mirror. Because the family’s second car was on loan to a relative, Balfour drove her husband to work that day, meaning the diaper bag was in the back, not on the passenger seat, as usual, where she could see it. Because of a phone conversation with a young relative in trouble, and another with her boss about a crisis at work, Balfour spent most of the trip on her cell, stressed, solving other people’s problems. Because the babysitter had a new phone, it didn’t yet contain Balfour’s office phone number, only her cell number, meaning that when the sitter phoned to wonder why Balfour hadn’t dropped Bryce off that morning, it rang unheard in Balfour’s pocketbook.\n\nThe holes, all of them, aligned.\n\nThere is no consistent character profile of the parent who does this to his or her child. The 13 who were interviewed for this story include the introverted and extroverted; the sweet, the sullen, the stoic and the terribly fragile. None of those descriptions exactly fits Lyn Balfour, a 37-year-old Army reservist who has served in combat zones and who seems to remain -- at least on the subject of the death of her son -- in battle.\n\n“I don’t feel I need to forgive myself,” she says plainly, “because what I did was not intentional.”\n\nBalfour is tall and stands taller, moving with a purposeful, swinging stride. She’s got a weak chin but a strong mouth that she uses without much editing. She’s funny and brassy and in your face, the sort of person you either like or don’t like, right away.\n\nIt had been Balfour’s idea to go to the trial of Miles Harrison, and it was she who walked up to Harrison in the hallway during a break, pushed past a crowd and threw her arms around his neck, pulling him close. For almost a full minute, she whispered in his ear. His eyes grew wider, and then he sobbed into her shoulder like a baby. What she had told him was who she was and that she knows he’d been a good, loving father, and he must not be ashamed.\n\nBalfour grew up medium-poor in Michigan. There was a man she’d been told was her father and a close family friend who, she later learned, was actually her father. Her two sets of grandparents wound up divorcing each other, then switching partners. There was alcoholism, divorce, a battle for custody. When Balfour turned 18, she was ready for the discipline of the Army.\n\nShe served in Bosnia and twice in Iraq, where she specialized in intelligence analysis and construction management, and where she discovered a skill at juggling a dozen things at once. She won a Bronze Star for managing $47 million in projects without mislaying a penny. She got married, had a son, divorced, met Jarrett Balfour and within a month decided this handsome, younger man would be her husband. Eighteen months later, he was. Bryce was their first child together. Braiden, conceived with Jarrett’s sperm when he was in Iraq, is their second. Today, in the same way, they’re trying for a third.\n\nBalfour has stopped at the fertility clinic for her procedure, and she’s now driving to the JAG school, to demonstrate where and how her son’s death happened. Down the road to the right is where she dropped Jarrett off at work, which was not customary, and which she theorizes put a subconscious check mark in her brain: Delivery made. Now she’s pointing out the house of the babysitter she’d driven obliviously past as she talked to her boss about a scheduling snafu and to her nephew about helping to pay his gambling debts. And here is the parking lot of the JAG school, on the University of Virginia campus. She’s pulling into the same spot she was parked in that day, the place where Bryce died.\n\n“It was like this, except these two spots next to us were empty,” she notes blandly as she gets out of the car, gathers her keys and leans in to get the diaper bag.\n\nThere is an almost pugnacious matter-of-factness about Lyn Balfour that can seem disconcerting, particularly if you have a preconception about how a person in her circumstances is supposed to face the world.\n\nYou might expect, for example, that she has gotten another car. But this black Honda Pilot with the pink Tinkerbell steering wheel cover is the same car Bryce died in, just inches from where Balfour is bending over Braiden to unstrap him.\n\n“It didn’t make financial sense to get a new car,” she says.\n\nBalfour’s eyes are impassive. Her attitude is clear:\n\nYou got a problem with that?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nNot all cases of infant hyperthermia in cars are like the ones this article is about: simple if bewildering lapses of memory by an otherwise apparently good parent. In other types of cases, there is a history of prior neglect, or evidence of substance abuse. Sometimes, the parent knowingly left the child in the car, despite the obvious peril. In one particularly egregious instance, a mother used her locked car as an inexpensive substitute for day care. When hyperthermia deaths are treated as crimes, these are the ones that tend to result in prison sentences.\n\nCases like Lyn Balfour’s, when prosecuted, typically end in some sort of compromise: a plea to a reduced charge, sometimes with probation and a suspended sentence, sometimes with community service. Going all the way to trial is a relative rarity.\n\nWhat happened to Balfour was even rarer. She was charged not with manslaughter, but with second-degree murder, carrying a possible prison sentence of up to 40 years. And as a condition of remaining free on bond, the court prohibited her from being alone with any minors, including her own teenage son.\n\nSo Balfour hired John Zwerling, a top-gun criminal defense lawyer from Alexandria. That meant that Jarrett Balfour, an employee of a civilian military contractor, had no choice but to take an assignment in Iraq. The extra combat pay would be needed for legal expenses. Lyn Balfour would have to face this alone.\n\nThat is when she began to move past grief and guilt and paralyzing self-doubt to a very specific, very focused anger.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nJohn Zwerling presents a passable version of Nero Wolfe, Rex Stout’s portly, eccentric genius hero of detective fiction. Zwerling’s law offices are in a handsome Old Town townhouse with dark walnut molding and dark wooden shutters. The boss is the guy with the Santa beard sitting in the chair with a hole in the leather, in jeans and a shirt with a big stain, the front buttons laboring mightily to do their job.\n\nZwerling’s first task, he says, was to make the case that second-degree murder was a preposterous charge in a case lacking even the faintest whisper of intent. That, he did. After a preliminary hearing, the charge was reduced to involuntary manslaughter. Zwerling’s second and more daunting job was to craft a defense for a case that was being prosecuted with what at times seemed like theatrical zeal.\n\nHere is how Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney Elizabeth Killeen would sum it up before the jury: “This little boy’s life did not have to end this way, on a hospital gurney. Deceased. Dead. His life squandered, and gone forever.”\n\nIn the end, Zwerling had one key decision to make. In criminal cases, jurors want to hear from the defendant. Zwerling liked and respected Balfour, but should he put her on the stand?\n\n“Have you met her?” he asks.\n\nYes.\n\n“Then you’ve seen that mental girdle she puts on, the protective armor against the world, how she closes up and becomes a soldier. It helps her survive, but it can seem off-putting if you’re someone who wants to see how crushed she is.” Zwerling decided not to risk it.\n\n“I wound up putting her on the stand in a different way,” he says, “so people could see the real Lyn -- vulnerable, with no guile, no posturing.”\n\nWhat Zwerling did was play two audiotapes for the jury. One was Balfour’s interrogation by police in the hospital about an hour after Bryce’s death; her answers are immeasurably sad, almost unintelligible, half sob, half whisper: “I killed my baby,” she says tremulously. “Oh, God, I’m so sorry.”\n\nThe second tape was a call to 911 made by a passerby, in those first few seconds after Balfour discovered the body and beseeched a stranger to summon help.\n\nZwerling swivels to his computer, punches up an audio file.\n\n“Want to hear it?”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBalfour is reenacting her movements from that day after work. She walks from her cubicle in room 153A of the JAG school, out to the front of the building. By mid-afternoon she had finally checked her cell and discovered she’d missed an early morning call from her babysitter. She called back, but got only voice mail. It didn’t worry her. She and the babysitter were friends, and they talked often about all sorts of things. Balfour left a message asking for a callback.\n\nIt came when she was standing where she is now, on a spacious stone patio in front of the JAG school, heading toward the parking lot. As it happens, there is a Civil War-era cannon that is aimed, with unsettling irony, exactly where she stands.\n\nThe babysitter asked Balfour where Bryce was. Balfour said: “What do you mean? He’s with you.”\n\nIt is 60 feet to the end of the patio, then a stairwell with 11 steps down, then two steps across, then a second stairwell, 12 steps down, one more off the curb and then a 30-foot sprint to the car. Balfour estimates the whole thing took half a minute or less. She knew it was too late when, through the window, she saw Bryce’s limp hand, and then his face, unmarked but lifeless and shiny, Balfour says, “like a porcelain doll.”\n\nIt was seconds later that the passerby called 911.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe tape is unendurable. Mostly, you hear a woman’s voice, tense but precise, explaining to a police dispatcher what she is seeing. Initially, there’s nothing in the background. Then Balfour howls at the top of her lungs, “OH, MY GOD, NOOOO!”\n\nThen, for a few seconds, nothing.\n\nThen a deafening shriek: “NO, NO, PLEASE, NO!!!”\n\nThree more seconds, then:\n\n“PLEASE, GOD, NO, PLEASE!!!”\n\nWhat is happening is that Balfour is administering CPR. At that moment, she recalls, she felt like two people occupying one body: Lyn, the crisply efficient certified combat lifesaver, and Lyn, the incompetent mother who would never again know happiness. Breathe, compress, breathe, compress. Each time that she came up for air, she lost it. Then, back to the patient.\n\nAfter hearing this tape, the jury deliberated for all of 90 minutes, including time for lunch. The not-guilty verdict was unanimous.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“I didn’t feel this case should ever have been brought,” says juror Colin Rosse, a retired radio executive. “It may have been negligence, but it was an honest mistake.”\n\nJury foreman James Schlothauer, an inspections official for the county government, doesn’t fault the prosecution; Balfour’s case was complex, he says, and the facts needed an airing. But the facts, he says, also made the verdict a slam dunk. It was “a big doggone accident,” he says, that might have happened to anyone.\n\nTo anyone?\n\nSchlothauer hesitates.\n\n“Well, it happened to me.”\n\nThe results were not catastrophic, Schlothauer says, but the underlying malfunction was similar: Busy and stressed, he and his wife once got their responsibilities confused, and neither stopped at day care for their daughter at the end of the day.\n\n“We both got home, and it was, ‘Wait, where’s Lily?’ ‘I thought you got her!’ ‘I thought you got her!’ “\n\nWhat if that mix-up had happened at the beginning of the day?\n\n“To anyone,” Schlothauer says.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThere is no national clearinghouse for cases of infant hyperthermia, no government agency charged with data collection and oversight. The closest thing is in the basement office of a comfortable home in suburban Kansas City, Kan., where a former sales and marketing executive named Janette Fennell runs a nonprofit organization called Kids and Cars. Kids and Cars lobbies for increased car safety for children, and as such maintains one of the saddest databases in America.\n\nFennell is on a sofa, her bare feet tucked under her, leafing through files. Amber, her college intern, walks up and plops a fax of a new wire service story on the table. “Frontover,” Amber says. “Parking lot, North Carolina.”\n\nThere’s a grisly terminology to this business. “Backovers” happen when you look in the rearview mirror and fail to see the child behind the car, or never look at all. “Frontovers” occur almost exclusively with pickups and SUVs, where the driver sits high off the ground. There are “power window strangulations” and “cars put in motion by child” and, finally, “hyperthermia.”\n\nIn a collage on Fennell’s wall are snapshots of dozens of infants and toddlers, some proudly holding up fingers, as if saying, “I’m 2!” Or “I’m 3!” The photos, typically, are from their final birthdays.\n\nFennell has met or talked with many of the parents in the hyperthermia cases, and some now work with her organization. She doesn’t seek them out. They find her name, often late at night, sleeplessly searching the Web for some sign that there are others who have lived in the same hell and survived. There is a general misconception, Fennell says, about who these people are: “They tend to be the doting parents, the kind who buy baby locks and safety gates.” These cases, she says, are failures of memory, not of love.\n\nFennell has an expression that’s half smile, half wince. She uses it often.\n\n“Some people think, ‘Okay, I can see forgetting a child for two minutes, but not eight hours.’ What they don’t understand is that the parent in his or her mind has dropped off the baby at day care and thinks the baby is happy and well taken care of. Once that’s in your brain, there is no reason to worry or check on the baby for the rest of the day.”\n\nFennell believes that prosecuting parents in this type of case is both cruel and pointless: It’s not as though the fear of a prison sentence is what will keep a parent from doing this.\n\nThe answer to the problem, Fennell believes, lies in improved car safety features and in increased public awareness that this can happen, that the results of a momentary lapse of memory can be horrifying.\n\nWhat is the worst case she knows of?\n\n“I don’t really like to . . .” she says.\n\nShe looks away. She won’t hold eye contact for this.\n\n“The child pulled all her hair out before she died.”\n\nFor years, Fennell has been lobbying for a law requiring back-seat sensors in new cars, sensors that would sound an alarm if a child’s weight remained in the seat after the ignition is turned off. Last year, she almost succeeded. The 2008 Cameron Gulbransen Kids’ Transportation Safety Act -- which requires safety improvements in power windows and in rear visibility, and protections against a child accidentally setting a car in motion -- originally had a rear seat-sensor requirement, too. It never made the final bill; sponsors withdrew it, fearing they couldn’t get it past a powerful auto manufacturers’ lobby.\n\nThere are a few aftermarket products that alert a parent if a child remains in a car that has been turned off. These products are not huge sellers. They have likely run up against the same marketing problem that confronted three NASA engineers a few years ago.\n\nIn 2000, Chris Edwards, Terry Mack and Edward Modlin began to work on just such a product after one of their colleagues, Kevin Shelton, accidentally left his 9-month-old son to die in the parking lot of NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. The inventors patented a device with weight sensors and a keychain alarm. Based on aerospace technology, it was easy to use; it was relatively cheap, and it worked.\n\nJanette Fennell had high hopes for this product: The dramatic narrative behind it, she felt, and the fact that it came from NASA, created a likelihood of widespread publicity and public acceptance.\n\nThat was five years ago. The device still isn’t on the shelves. The inventors could not find a commercial partner willing to manufacture it. One big problem was liability. If you made it, you could face enormous lawsuits if it malfunctioned and a child died. But another big problem was psychological: Marketing studies suggested it wouldn’t sell well.\n\nThe problem is this simple: People think this could never happen to them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“I was that guy, before. I’d read the stories, and I’d go, ‘What were those parents thinking?’ “\n\nMikey Terry is a contractor from Maypearl, Tex., a big man with soft eyes. At the moment he realized what he’d done, he was in the cab of a truck and his 6-month-old daughter, Mika, was in a closed vehicle in the broiling Texas sun in a parking lot 40 miles away. So his frantic sprint to the car was conducted at 100 miles an hour in a 30-foot gooseneck trailer hauling thousands of pounds of lumber the size of telephone poles.\n\nOn that day in June 2005, Terry had been recently laid off, and he’d taken a day job building a wall in the auditorium of a Catholic church just outside of town. He’d remembered to drop his older daughter at day care, but as he was driving the baby to a different day care location, he got a call about a new permanent job. This really caught his attention. It was a fatal distraction.\n\nTerry, 35, wasn’t charged with a crime. His punishment has been more subtle.\n\nThe Terrys are Southern Baptists. Before Mika’s death, Mikey Terry says, church used to be every Sunday, all day Sunday, morning Bible study through evening meal. He and his wife, Michele, don’t go much anymore. It’s too confusing, he says.\n\n“I feel guilty about everyone in church talking about how blessed we all are. I don’t feel blessed anymore. I feel I have been wronged by God. And that I have wronged God. And I don’t know how to deal with that.”\n\nFour years have passed, but he still won’t go near the Catholic church he’d been working at that day. As his daughter died outside, he was inside, building a wall on which would hang an enormous crucifix.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“This is a case of pure evil negligence of the worse kind . . . He deserves the death sentence.”\n\n“I wonder if this was his way of telling his wife that he didn’t really want a kid.”\n\n“He was too busy chasing after real estate commissions. This shows how morally corrupt people in real estate-related professions are.”\n\nThese were readers’ online comments to The Washington Post news article of July 10, 2008, reporting the circumstances of the death of Miles Harrison’s son. These comments were typical of many others, and they are typical of what happens again and again, year after year in community after community, when these cases arise. A substantial proportion of the public reacts not merely with anger, but with frothing vitriol.\n\nEd Hickling believes he knows why. Hickling is a clinical psychologist from Albany, N.Y., who has studied the effects of fatal auto accidents on the drivers who survive them. He says these people are often judged with disproportionate harshness by the public, even when it was clearly an accident, and even when it was indisputably not their fault.\n\nHumans, Hickling said, have a fundamental need to create and maintain a narrative for their lives in which the universe is not implacable and heartless, that terrible things do not happen at random, and that catastrophe can be avoided if you are vigilant and responsible.\n\nIn hyperthermia cases, he believes, the parents are demonized for much the same reasons. “We are vulnerable, but we don’t want to be reminded of that. We want to believe that the world is understandable and controllable and unthreatening, that if we follow the rules, we’ll be okay. So, when this kind of thing happens to other people, we need to put them in a different category from us. We don’t want to resemble them, and the fact that we might is too terrifying to deal with. So, they have to be monsters.”\n\nAfter Lyn Balfour’s acquittal, this comment appeared on the Charlottesville News Web site:\n\n“If she had too many things on her mind then she should have kept her legs closed and not had any kids. They should lock her in a car during a hot day and see what happens.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLyn Balfour’s Ruckersville home is fragrant with spice candles and the faintly sweet feel of kitsch. Braiden boings happily in a baby bouncer, the same one Bryce had, and crawls on a patchwork comforter that had been Bryce’s, too. As Balfour is text-messaging Jarrett in Iraq, she’s checking out Braiden’s diaper, multitasking as always.\n\n“People say I’m a strong woman,” Balfour says, “but I’m not. It’s just that when I grieve, I grieve alone . . .”\n\nThe pacifier pops out of Braiden’s mouth. Balfour rinses it, pops it back in.\n\n“ . . . because deep down I feel I don’t have the right to grieve in front of others.”\n\nBalfour says she has carefully crafted the face she shows the world.\n\n“I would like to disappear, to move someplace where no one knows who I am and what I did. I would do that in a heartbeat, but I can’t. I have to say my name. I’m the lady who killed her child, and I have to be that lady because I promised Bryce.”\n\nThe promise, she says, came as she held her son’s body in the hospital. “I kissed him for the last time, and I told him how sorry I was, and I said I would do everything in my power to make sure this will never happen to another child.”\n\nBalfour has done this in a way suited to her personality; she has become a modern, maternal version of the Ancient Mariner, from time to time brazenly bellying up to strangers in places such as Sam’s Club and starting a conversation about children, so she can tell them what she did to one of hers. An in-your-face cautionary tale.\n\nUnlike most parents to whom this has happened, Balfour will talk to the media, anytime. She works with Kids and Cars, telling her story repeatedly. Her point is always consistent, always resolute, always tinged with a little anger, always a little self-serving, sometimes a bit abrasive: This can happen to anyone. This is a mistake, not a crime, and should not be prosecuted. Cars need safety devices to prevent this. She seldom seems in doubt or in particular anguish. No one sees her cry.\n\n“The truth is,” she says, “the pain never gets less. It’s never dulled. I just put it away for a while, until I’m in private. “\n\nBalfour doesn’t like to think about Bryce’s final ordeal. A kindly doctor once told her that her son probably didn’t suffer a great deal, and she clings to this resolutely. In her mind, Bryce died unafraid, surrounded by consoling angels. The deity Balfour believes in loves us unconditionally and takes a direct hand in our lives; this delivers comfort, but also doubt.\n\n“When I was 16 in high school,” she says, “I was date-raped. I had an abortion. I never told anyone, not my friends and not my mother. As the abortion was happening, I prayed to God and asked Him to take the baby back, and give him back to me when I could take care of him.”\n\nSo . . .?\n\n“So, I do wonder, sometimes . . .\n\nBalfour wipes a tear.\n\n“ . . . It’s there in the back of my mind, that what happened to me is punishment from God. I killed a child, and then I had one ripped away from me at the peak of my happiness.”\n\nOn the floor, Braiden is entranced by an Elmo doll.\n\n“Sometimes,” Balfour says, “I wish I had died in childbirth with him . . .”\n\nShe’s weeping now. For the moment, there’s no soldier left.\n\n“ . . . that way, Jarrett could have Braiden, and I could be with Bryce.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMiles Harrison is in a Leesburg Starbucks, seated next to the condiment station, pulling napkin after napkin to dry his eyes.\n\n“I hurt my wife so much,” he says, “and by the grace of whatever wonderful quality is within her, she has forgiven me. And that makes me feel even worse. Because I can’t forgive me.”\n\nIn the months after he was acquitted in the death of his son, Harrison’s public agony continued. His mug shot was back in the newspapers after the Russian Foreign Ministry officially protested his acquittal and threatened to halt the country’s adoption program with Americans. It was something of an international incident.\n\nFor months, Harrison declined to speak for this article, but in early February, he said he was ready.\n\n“I pray for forgiveness from the Russian people,” he said. “There are good people in this country who deserve children, and there are children in Russia who need parents. Please don’t punish everyone for my mistake.”\n\nHarrison is a Roman Catholic. Weeks after Chase’s death, he returned to his local church, where priest and parishioners left him to grieve in solitude. Afterward, the priest embraced him and whispered in his ear: “I will always be here for you.”\n\nThe church is St. Francis de Sales in Purcellville. The priest was Father Michael Kelly. On New Year’s Eve, on a windswept road after a heavy rain, as Father Michael stopped to move a tree that had fallen across the road, he was struck by another falling tree and killed.\n\nHarrison doesn’t know what to make of this; nothing entirely holds together anymore, except, to his astonishment, his marriage.\n\nIn their home, Carol and Miles Harrison have kept Chase’s nursery exactly as it was, and the child’s photos are all over. “Sometimes we’ll look at a picture together,” Harrison says, “and I will see Carol cry. She tries not to let me see, but I see, and I feel such guilt and hurt.”\n\nHarrison says he knows it is unlikely he and Carol will be allowed to adopt again.\n\nHe leans forward, his voice breaking into a sobbing falsetto, as it did in the courtroom at his worse moment of shame.\n\n“I have cheated her out of being a mother.”\n\nIn Starbucks, heads turn.\n\n“She would be the best mother in the world.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe first time, someone answers the phone but doesn’t say anything. There is just the sound of a TV turned up way too loud, and after a little while, the phone clicks dead. A few days later, he answers, but the TV is not lowered. Call back later, he says. On the third day, he takes the call.\n\nAre you doing okay?\n\n“I don’t even know. Tryin’ to take it day by day.”\n\nAndrew Culpepper’s voice is a flat monotone, like a man in a trance. His sentences are short and truncated. This is the sanitation department electrician in Portsmouth, the lucky one. He was the man who wasn’t criminally charged when Miles Harrison was. He never had to legally defend himself.\n\nAre you alone now?\n\n“Yeah. “\n\nShe left you?\n\n“Yeah. She’s hurt and stuff. Dealing with it her way, I guess.”\n\nAre you thankful you weren’t prosecuted?\n\nNo answer.\n\nAndrew?\n\n“Not for myself, for my parents. Doesn’t matter what they do to me. Nothing I don’t do to myself every day.”\n\nAre you sure you’re okay?\n\n“I try to take my mind off it. When I start thinking about it, I get like . . .”\n\nLike what?\n\nSilence for the longest time.\n\n“Like this.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAs part of her plan to simplify her life, Lyn Balfour has quit her job. It’s going to get a little more complicated soon, because she’s pregnant again: The insemination that she had on that day in October was successful. The baby is due in July.\n\nBalfour’s laywers petitioned the court to get the record of her prosecution expunged. Such a request is usually unopposed after an acquittal, in recognition that a legally innocent person has a right to start again with a legally clean slate. But in this case, Commonwealth’s Attorney Dave Chapman challenged it and, unusually, argued the relatively small legal battle himself.\n\nOutside the courthouse, Chapman ex-plained: “It’s very rare to oppose expungement. But we are, because of the enormity of this case, because it is the sole public record of the death of a completely defenseless and helpless infant.”\n\nAfter a half-day hearing, the judge ruled for the commonwealth, saying Balfour had failed to prove that she would suffer a “manifest injustice” if the court records remained unsealed.\n\nAfterward, Balfour calmly answered questions from the news media, as always. She was unemotional, unapologetic, on message. She will consider an appeal. She will continue to speak out for greater public awareness of the dangers of leaving children alone in cars. She sounded, as always, just a little bit cold.\n\nJarrett Balfour finally made it home, after 18 months in Iraq, where his job was to analyze seized explosive devices made by insurgents and try to identify their technology and trace their origin. He extended his tour of duty twice, as the legal bills kept mounting. Jarrett is 30\\. He’s tall, lanky and strikingly handsome, with sandy hair brushed straight back. He looks like a man leaning into a strong wind.\n\nInitially after he got home, Jarrett says, things were awkward, with “hiccups” in communication. He would make an innocuous statement about something Braiden was doing, and Lyn would overreact, as if he were second-guessing her parenting skills. It’s getting better, he says.\n\nBraiden is 91/2 months old, exactly the age Bryce was when he died. Lyn has been having nightmares again.\n\nJust before the tragedy, she had two dreams that seem to her, in retrospect, like foreboding. In one, she accidentally drowned Bryce; in the other, it was death by fire. Balfour believes these dreams were sent by God to help prepare her for what she was about to endure.\n\nRecently she dreamed she lost control of Braiden’s stroller, and it rolled out into traffic. No, she doesn’t think it’s the same thing, happening again.\n\n“I couldn’t take it again,” Jarrett says quietly.\n\nSo, there are tensions. They are working it out. Both of them say they are confident this marriage will last.\n\nAfter Jarrett leaves for work, Lyn talks about how much the presence of Braiden has helped them heal. She considers her family blessed because they’ve been able to have other children:\n\n“Can you imagine losing your only child and not having a hope of having another? Can you imagine that despair?”\n\nThat’s why, she says, she’s made a decision. She’s checked it out, and it would be legal. There would be no way for any authority to stop it because it would fall into the class of a private adoption. She’d need a sperm donor and an egg donor, because she wouldn’t want to use her own egg. That would make it too personal.\n\nWhat is she saying, exactly?\n\nMiles and Carol Harrison deserve another child, Balfour explains measuredly. They would be wonderful parents.\n\nThis is the woman you either like or don’t like, right away. She is brassy and strong-willed and, depending on your viewpoint, refreshingly open or abrasively forward. Above all, she is decisive.\n\nBalfour says she’s made up her mind. If Miles and Carol Harrison are denied another adoption, if they exhaust all their options and are still without a baby, she will offer to carry one for them, as a gift.\n\nGene Weingarten is a staff writer for the Magazine.

Black, blues, and boogie-woogie piano players.\" That's what that rockabilly, rock 'n roll style came from.\" He said, \"Oh, no! Jerry Lee invented that. I ain't ever heard no black man except for you play like that.\" So I'm thinking this guy has never heard Fats Domino or Little Richard and then he says, \"You know, this is the first time I ever sat down and had a drink with a black man?\"\n\n![](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/08/20/20170629_daryl_davis_015_custom-b6e5c20f962425b2d795ba585f3cc5e5943ef0f0-s1100-c50.jpg) \n\n Daryl Davis first befriended a member of the Ku Klux Klan in a bar where he was performing.

He says they bonded over liking the same type of music.\n\n Courtesy of Jonathan Timmes \n\nWell, now I'm getting curious. I'm trying to figure out, now how is it that in my 25 years on the face of this earth that I have sat down, literally, with thousands of white people, had a beverage, a meal, a conversation or anybody else, and this guy is 15 to 20 years older than me and he's never sat down with a black guy before and had a drink. I said, \"How is that? Why?\" At first, he didn't answer me and he had a friend sitting next to him and he elbowed him and said, \"Tell him, tell him, tell him,\" and he finally said, \"I'm a member of the Ku Klux Klan.\"\n\n**On his reaction on hearing he was talking a member of the Klan**\n\nI just burst out laughing because I really did not believe him. I thought he was pulling my leg. As I was laughing, he pulled out his wallet, flipped through his credit cards and pictures and produced his Klan card and handed it to me. Immediately, I stopped laughing. I recognized the logo on there, the Klan symbol and I realized this was for real, this guy wasn't joking. And now I'm wondering, why am I sitting by a Klansman?\n\nBut he was very friendly, it was the music that brought us together. He wanted me to call him and let him know anytime I was to return to this bar with this band. The fact that a Klansman and black person could sit down at the same table and enjoy the same music, that was a seed planted. So what do you do when you plant a seed? You nourish it. That was the impetus for me to write a book. I decided to go around the country and sit down with Klan leaders and Klan members to find out: How can you hate me when you don't even know me?\n\n**On what he says to a Klansman** \n\nThe best thing you do is you study up on the subject as much as you can. I went in armed, not with a weapon, but with knowledge. I knew as much about the Klan, if not more than many of the Klan people that I interviewed. When they see that you know about their organization, their belief system, they respect you. Whether they like you or not, they respect the fact that you've done your homework. Just like any good salesman, you want a return visit and they recognized that I'd done my homework, which allowed me to come back again.\n\n[![Tracing The Dark Origins Of Charlottesville's KKK ](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/08/19/gettyimages-810944492_sq-2010774b20135c7687f4e9cae1c14d4937bb267a-s300-c85.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/08/19/543968997/tracing-the-dark-origins-of-charlottesvilles-kkk)\n\nThat began to chip away at their ideology because when two enemies are talking, they're not fighting. It's when the talking ceases that the ground becomes fertile for violence. If you spend five minutes with your worst enemy — it doesn't have to be about race, it could be about anything...you will find that you both have something in common. As you build upon those commonalities, you're forming a relationship and as you build about that relationship, you're forming a friendship. That's what would happen. I didn't convert anybody. They saw the light and converted themselves.\n\n**On what the Klansmen thought when he asked them why they hated him** \n\nInitially, they feel that if you're not white, you are inferior. \\[They believe\\] that black people have smaller brains, we're incapable of higher achievement. I'll give you an example of one. This guy was an exalted cyclops sitting in my car in my passenger seat. He made the statement, which I'd heard before, \"Well we all know that all black people have within them a gene that makes them violent.\" I turned to him and I'm driving and I said, \"Wait a minute. I'm as black as anybody you've ever seen. I have never done a carjacking or a driveby, how do you explain that?\" He didn't even pause to think about it. He said, \"Your gene is latent. It hasn't come out yet.\"\n\nSo how do you argue with somebody who is that far out in left field? I was dumbfounded. I'm just driving along. He's sitting over here all smug and secure, like \"See you have no response?\" And I thought about it for a minute. Then I used his point of reference. I said, \"Well, we all know that all white people have a gene within them that makes them a serial killer.\" He says, \"What do you mean?\" And I said,\"Well, name me three black serial killers.\" He thought about it — he could not do it. I said, Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, Charles Manson, John Wayne Gacy. All whites. I said, \"Son, you are a serial killer.\" He says \"Daryl, I've never killed anybody.\" I said, \"Your gene is latent. It hasn't come out yet.\" He goes, \"Well, that's stupid!\" I said, \"Well, duh. Yes, but you know what, you're right. What I said was stupid, but no more stupid than what you said you me.\" Then he got very, very quiet and changed the subject. Five months later, based on that conversation he left the Klan. His robe was the first robe I ever got.\n\n_Matthew Schwartz produced the audio for this story.

The shrine as\nyou can see is built out of wood, never a\nmaterial prized for millennial scale\nstructural integrity but the (???)\npriests who run the shrine know that so\nperiodically they have a ceremony where\nthey tear the shrine to the ground and\nthen they go to the forest where the\nwood from the original shrine built in\n690 came from and they build another\nshrine out of the same kind of material\non the same spot to the same architectural plan \nand from their point of view,\nsince the function of the shrine\nis to delineate sacred space from\nordinary space the shrine has been there\nfor 1300 years. It's just built out of\nrenewable materials \nUNESCO's response was that's not what we mean when we say\nhistoric. Right? what we care about is solidity of edifice\nnot solidity of process.\nHold that thought. In 1995 I was in\ncharge of technology for a little web\nshop in Manhattan or a dozen of us\nworking out of Seth(???) Goldstein's living\nroom; it was very picturesque and like\nthe dog that caught the... proverbial dog\nthat caught the bus we landed AT\u0026T as a\nclient.\nWe had some calendaring technology they wanted to use and \nthey hired us to build some web sites and \nonce the ink on the contract was dry the engineers came\naround and so of course we had to have a\nfight about programming languages. It's\nlike hello between techies so this was\nbig culture clash. Most of those guys had\nbeen at AT\u0026T longer than most of us had\nbeen out of college. They were C++\nengineers, C++ having been invented at\nAT\u0026T.\nWe were Perl hackers, so already\nthey were horrified and we fought back\nand forth about the relative merits of\neach language and the place they really\nthought they had us was on support. \n\"Where can you possibly get commercial support \nfor Perl?\" and we said \"we don't have any\" \n\"You don't have any support?!\"\nwe said \"We... we didn't say that, we said we don't \nhave commercial support. We get our support from the\nPerl community\"\nand from the looks on their faces you could tell \nas if it was, as if we had told them \"We get our\nThursday's from a banana\" \nlike it just didn't make any sense \nwhat we just said. They'd never heard the words community\nand support in the same sentence \nSo it's another \"look look there's this, there's\nthis news group comp Lang Perl misc\", all\nright and we go to that news group and\nwe post our questions and other people\nanswer them and other people post their\nquestions and we answer them. We all kind\nof get it done together. This did not\nmake any sense. More arguing. \"Look\"\nwe said, \"we'll show you\". So we come up\nwith a moderately complicated question\nwe post it to Usenet, we had an answer\nbefore the meeting was over and who it\nwas at that moment that I understood\nwhat was going on. Because they didn't\ncare. They didn't care that they'd seen\nit work in practice because they already\nknew it couldn't work in theory. Right.\nSupport is critical. You don't get\nsupport from something as evanescent as\nan unspoken bargain in a community;\nsupport comes from something concrete\nlike a contract with a company. right. so\nwe had that argument a dozen years ago\nwhat's going on now well the slide I\njust pulled up and I'll pull up again is\nactually from yesterday this is from\ncomp lang perl misc from yesterday.\nPeople are still asking questions people\nare still answering questions with the\nexplosion of social media that we've\nseen there's obviously lots and lots of\nplaces to talk about perl now but the\noriginal site of the conversation and\nthe the source of the argument comp Lang\nperl misc is doing fine. And AT\u0026T. How's AT\u0026T\ndoing? Not as fine, right, so in fact\nright, th-the solidity was on the side\nof the thing that looked evanescent.\nPerl is a Shinto shrine. Perl exists not as\nan edifice but as an act of love. \nPerl is a viable programming option again\ntoday because millions of people woke up\nthis morning loving perl, and more\nimportantly, they love one another in the\ncontext of perl. They love one another\nenough to stop what they're doing and\nlisten to each other to have a\nconversation (???? to Denise's point) and to\nanswer questions for one another, to\ndiagnose things for one another,\nsometimes to write codes for one another.\nOh I think I see what's going on here\nTry this - no contracts are written, no\nmoney changes hands, the work goes on.\nWe don't often talk about love at\ngatherings like this it seems too\nsquishy and certainly seem too squishy\nto the AT\u0026T guys but what has\nhappened, what is happening in our\ngeneration right now is that we have a set\nof tools for aggregating things that\npeople care about in ways that increase\nboth the scope and the longevity in ways\nthat were unpredictable even a decade\nago. right. The coordinating tools we now\nhave, and I'm not talking about anything\nfancy, I'm talking about mailing lists\nand Usenet and web blogs and wikis; \nthose tools turn love into a renewable\nbuilding material. \nIn the middle of the 90s most software was commercially\nmanufactured, but there were a handful of\nthings whose only visible means of\nsupport was love plus mailing lists.\nWhich doesn't seem like a very\nauspicious place to start. Perl. Apache.\nLinux. But standing there and looking\ntoday, and more importantly standing from\ntoday looking towards the future you\nwill make more accurate predictions\nabout about software, and in this web\ndriven world about services, if you ask\nyourself not what's the business model\nbut rather \"do the people who like it\ntake care of each other?\" \nThat turns out to be the better predictor of longevity\nThe (???) priests would totally get Linux \nLinux gets rebuilt every night by people whose principle\ngoal is that it continues to exist the following morning.\nNow this doesn't mean that the market is going to wither\naway and we're all going to live in some\nsort of lovely post-capitalist commune.\nThere's lots of commercial opportunity.\nThere has always been lots of commercial\nopportunity; there will always be lots of\ncommercial opportunity. \nIt does mean that the ability to aggregate \nnon-financial motivations, to get people together\noutside of managerial culture and for\nreasons other than the profit motive has\nreceived a huge comparative advantage.\nAnd it also means that many of the\nfuture commercial opportunities are\ngoing to be inextricably intertwined\nwith that kind of work and those kind of\ngroups. Right. When Linus Torvalds posted\nhis first message in 1991 hinting at\nwhat Linux was to become - it's a very\nmodest message \"I've got this little\nhobby project project in mind\" \nwithin 24 hours he had responses from Stuttgart,\nfrom Vienna, from San Jose, from Sydney,\nhe had a global network of collaborators\nnot asking for anything other than the\nchance to come together and do something\ninteresting that was new. And that\npattern that pattern of aggregating\ncaring into something stable and\nlong-lasting is going everywhere\nWikipedia. The anti anti-immigration\nprotests in the California schools that\nwere coordinated through myspace. right.\nThe monitoring of the Nigerian elections\nby a loose collection of people using\nSMS and camera phones to watch their own\nelected officials.\nThe use of Flickr to coordinate information and disaster\nrelief after the Indian Ocean tsunami after the London transit bombings after the Madrid bombing. \nAnd the number of places that pattern will go in the future is much greater than the number of places that pattern has already gone\nWe have always loved one another we're\nhuman it's something we're good at but\nup until recently the radius and\nhalf-life of that affection has been\nquite limited. With love alone you can\nget a birthday party together. Add\ncoordinating tools and you can write an.\noperating system.\nIn the past, we would do little things\nfor love. But big things, big things\nrequired money. Now we can do big things\nfor love.

Basprin? Oh yeah! Asprin!  \nWhich I paid about a buck for down at the local drugstore.\n\nThe debate briefly abates as my hosts collect plates  \nBut as they return with desserts Storm pertly asserts:  \n\"Shakespeare said it first:  \nThere are more things in heaven and  \nEarth than exist in your philosophy.  \nScience is just how we're trained to look at reality,  \nIt doesn't explain love or spirituality.  \nHow does science explain psychics?

If I had written this essay five years ago, it would be be titled “Why Tribalism Is Stupid And Needs To Be Destroyed”. Since then, I’ve changed my mind. I’ve found that I enjoy being in tribes as much as anyone else. Part of this was resolving a major social fallacy I’d had throughout high school and college, which was that the correct way to make friends was to pick the five most interesting people I knew and try to befriend them. This almost never worked and I thought it meant I had terrible social skills. Then I looked at what everyone else was doing, and I found that instead of isolated surgical strikes of friendship, they were forming groups. The band people. The mock trial people. The football team people. The Three Popular Girls Who Went Everywhere Together. Once I tried “falling in with” a group, friendship became much easier and self-sustaining precisely because of all of the tribal development that happens when a group of similar people all know each other and have a shared interest. Since then I’ve had good luck finding tribes I like and that accept me – the rationalists being the most obvious example, but even interacting with my coworkers on the same hospital unit at work is better than trying to find and cultivate random people. Some benefits of tribalism are easy to explain. Tribalism intensifies all positive and prosocial feelings within the tribe. It increases trust within the tribe and allows otherwise-impossible forms of cooperation – remember Haidt on the Jewish diamond merchants outcompeting their rivals because their mutual Judaism gave them a series of high-trust connections that saved them costly verification procedures? It gives people a support network they can rely on when their luck is bad and they need help. It lets you “be yourself” without worrying that this will be incomprehensible or offensive to somebody who thinks totally differently from you. It creates an instant densely-connected social network of people who mostly get along with one another. It makes people feel like part of something larger than themselves, which makes them happy and can  improves their physical and mental health.  \n \n- Eliezer thinks every cause wants to be a cult. I would phrase this more neutrally as “every cause wants to be a tribe”.  \n\n- This can happen over anything or nothing at all. Despite the artificial nature of the Robbers’ Cove experiment, its groups are easily recognized as tribes. Indeed, the reason this experiment is so interesting is that it shows tribes in their purest form; no veneer of really being about pushing a social change or supporting a caliph, just tribes for tribalism’s sake. \n\n- ethnogenesis  \n\n- My model of ethnogenesis involves four stages: pre-existing differences, a rallying flag, development, and dissolution.  \n\n- Pre-existing differences are the raw materials out of which tribes are made. A good tribe combines people who have similar interests and styles of interaction even before the ethnogenesis event. Any description of these differences will necessarily involve stereotypes, but a lot of them should be hard to argue.  \n\n- The rallying flag is the explicit purpose of the tribe. It’s usually a belief, event, or activity that get people with that specific pre-existing difference together and excited.  \n\n- Development is all of the processes by which the fledgling tribe gains its own culture and history. It’s a turning-inward and strengthening-of-walls, which transforms it from ‘A Group Of People Who Do Not Believe In God And Happen To Be In The Same Place’ to ‘The Atheist Tribe’.  \n\n- Dissolution is optional. The point of the previous three steps is to build a “wall” between the tribe and the outside, a series of systematic differences that let everybody know which side they’re on. If a tribe was never really that different from the surrounding population, stops caring that much about its rallying flag, and doesn’t develop enough culture, then the wall fails and the members disperse into the surrounding population.  \n\n- It seems to me that people have an urge toward cultural self-preservation which is as strong or stronger as the urge to individual self-preservation. Part of this is rational cost-benefit calculation – if someone loses their only tribe and ends up alone in the vast and atomized sea of modern society, it might take years before they can find another tribe and really be at home there. But a lot of it seems to be beyond that, an emotional certainty that losing one’s culture and having it replaced with another is not okay, any more than being killed at the same time someone else has a baby is okay.  \n\n- If you take only one thing from this essay, it’s that communities are best understood not logically but historically.  \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":[]},"/meta/now":{"title":"now","content":"\nLast updated on 2023-06-10\n\n \n\nThings I want to work on / I'm working on right now: \n\n1.

He used this term to describe the phenomenon of experts believing news articles written on topics outside of their fields of expertise, yet acknowledging that articles written in the same publication within their fields of expertise are error-ridden and full of misunderstanding:[143]\n\n    Media carries with it a credibility that is totally undeserved. You have all experienced this, in what I call the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. (I refer to it by this name because I once discussed it with Murray Gell-Mann, and by dropping a famous name I imply greater importance to myself, and to the effect, than it would otherwise have.)\n\n    Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the \"wet streets cause rain\" stories. Paper's full of them.\n\n    In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.\n\n    That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I'd point out it does not operate in other arenas of life. In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount everything they say. In court, there is the legal doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, which means untruthful in one part, untruthful in all. But when it comes to the media, we believe against evidence that it is probably worth our time to read other parts of the paper. When, in fact, it almost certainly isn't. The only possible explanation for our behavior is amnesia.\n```\n\n- [ ] Gell-Mann Amnesia effect ✅ 2023-05-26\n\n- [ ] Gibson's law\n- [ ] Hick's law\n- [ ] Hitchens's razor\n- [ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armitage_Miller\n\n```before_sunrise\nHave you ever heard that  \nas couples get older, they lose  \ntheir ability to hear each other?  \n  \nJesse: No.  \n\nCéline: Well, supposedly, men lose the  \nability to hear higher-pitched sounds,  \nand women eventually lose hearing in  \nthe low end.

Bayes' theorem: This is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs or hypotheses based on new evidence or data. It shows how the prior probability of a hypothesis (what we already know or assume) and the likelihood of the evidence (how well the evidence supports the hypothesis) affect the posterior probability of the hypothesis (what we learn after seeing the evidence).\n4. Betteridge's law of headlines: This is an informal rule that states that any headline that ends with a question mark can be answered by \"no\". The idea is that if the answer was \"yes\", the headline would state it as a fact, rather than posing it as a question.\n5. Bradford's law: This is a empirical law that describes how the frequency of citations of scientific papers varies according to the rank of the journals in which they are published. It states that a core set of journals in any given field will account for most of the citations, while the rest will be distributed among a larger set of less influential journals.\n6. Campbell's law: This is a social science principle that states that when a metric is used as a target or indicator of performance, it tends to lose its validity and distort the system it is supposed to measure. This is because people will try to manipulate or game the metric to achieve the desired outcome, rather than improving the underlying process or quality.\n7. Last universal common ancestor: This is the hypothetical organism that is the most recent common ancestor of all living organisms on Earth. It is estimated to have lived about 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago, and to have had a simple cellular structure and genetic code.\n8. Abiogenesis: This is the natural process by which life arises from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. It is also known as the origin of life, and it is one of the major unsolved problems in biology.\n9. Wiio's laws: These are a set of humorous aphorisms that describe how communication often fails or leads to misunderstanding. They are named after Osmo Wiio, a Finnish professor and politician, who formulated them in 1978. Some examples are: \"Communication usually fails, except by accident.\" \"If communication can fail, it will.\" \"The more communication there is, the more difficult it is for communication to succeed.\"\n  \n---\n\n2023-04-18 \n- [ ] Argument map \n\n\n2023-07-07\n\n - The Overton window is an approach to identifying the ideas that define the spectrum of acceptability of governmental policies.

They don't live long. No queen means no males.\nWhat's interesting is societal roles of ants within the colony. Each any has a specific role within the colony. These would appear to be a collective of foragers. They ate either all from the same colony or they are Argentine ants. Ants produce pheromones. Most ants if the same species but of different colonies will fight and kill each other. Argentine ants are the only known species that don't do this and we don't know why. In theory, all Argentine ants form a single colony which would be insane because they are found on multiple continents.\nAnts death spirals exist so this single instance of these ants operating without a queen is the only known example of this behavior in ants in the entire world, as to my knowledge. I'm an exterminator just shy of a decade in the industry. I have no degree in entomology, so there are many much more knowledgeable folks than myself.\nTermite colonies have complex climate control that includes bringing moisture with them wherever the colony expands.\nSolitary wasps produce no known allergens.\nWolf spider and yellow sack spider bite can cause necrosis if the person bitten reacts badly.

I can talk for hours about pest control. I'd say the majority of exterminators that have more than a few years in can do the same. We don't bring it up unless asked. Most people don't have a clue as RI the extensive knowledge their exterminator actually has. The majority of what we do is simply maintence.\nThe insect world is vast. There are so many different insects even regionally, not to mentioned rarity of various species. I dont come across many new insects anymore, the ones I do happen to be very rare in my region. At this point, the things that surprise me tend to be new places I've found bugs. I've seen ant colony is working and running aquarium aerators. I found a colony living underneath the glass of an aquarium. They were almost completely contained living along the exterior. They collected food from spilled fish food, moisture from condensate off the glass as well as moisture from the tank itself. I had my suspicions on bedbugs feeding off creatures other than humans before the science suggested it was possible, through my own observations. I had a really bad bedbug job, possibly the worst one I've ever seen. I found them living in a bird cage and 2 pet carriers for dogs. Until this point, the science said they didn't do that. There is something called a bat bug that looks damn near identical to a bedbug that feeds off of bats. We know they will take a blood meal off of humans but require bat blood to reproduce and complete their stage changes. Seemed to me that despite what the science said, in a similar situation, bedbugs could take a blood meal from a different source, but still require human blood to reproduce and also complete their stage changes. I found a type of solitary Prarie bee that prefers a specific soil composition to build their nest. An entire half acre plot land with a hole about every square inch. Thousands of these things took over these peoples yard. They run for about 6 weeks in the spring. I had one and another tech had one at the same time in a different location. I've only ever seen this once and I've never seen anything quite like it. Cicada killers behave in a similar manner, they also run about 6 weeks in my region, just in late summer, but you never see those kinds of number. 30 in a yard is a lot. I ended up calling the Perdue University Department of Entomology amd spoke with a grad student working on a PH.D. The gentleman ended up doing some quick research for me and found a paper written by someone with a Doctorates in Entomology about having the same issues in his garden. Absolutely fascinating stuff, and begged me not to kill them as loss of habitat has forced them into situations like this. They aren't endangered yet, but they are in that path. I explained the situation to the home owner and gave them some other compromised solutions that they decided to try. I told them I would kill them if they truly wanted me to, but they would come back. The solution is changing the soil composition, they ended up mulching an area for the kids and dogs to play in and let the bee have their 6 weeks with the rest of the yard. That one left me all warm and fuzzy. It's not often we get to find a solution like that. The bees were happy the homeowner was happy.\nIf you want to know about all the insect and insect eggs you eat on a daily basis, message me. Those discussions tend to freak people out.

When another driver cuts me up, I might  \njudge that he’s a selfish thoughtless toad, but in fact, he might be taking his  \nwife to hospital as she’s about to give birth. Thoughts are not necessarily  \ntrue, accurate or helpful. Often based on emotion (rather than facts), which  \ndrives our opinion. Don’t believe everything you think!  \n Are automatic. They just happen, popping into your head and you often won’t  \neven notice them.  \n Our thoughts are ours – they can be quite specific to us, perhaps because of  \nour present or past experience, knowledge, values and culture, or just for no  \ngood reason at all. Some thoughts are so out of keeping with all those things,  \nand that can make them seem all the more distressing – because we add  \nsome meaning about why we had them (I must be a bad person!)  \n Habitual and persistent – our thoughts seem to repeat over and over, and the  \nmore they repeat, the more believable they seem, then they set off a whole  \nchain of new related thoughts that lead us to feel worse and worse.

Le Guin's The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction, 1986**\n\n---\nIn the temperate and tropical regions where it appears that hominids evolved into human beings, the principal food of the species was vegetable. Sixty-five to eighty percent of what human beings ate in those regions in Paleolithic, Neolithic, and prehistoric times was gathered; only in the extreme Arctic was meat the staple food. The mammoth hunters spectacularly occupy the cave wall and the mind, but what we actually did to stay alive and fat was gather seeds, roots, sprouts, shoots, leaves, nuts, berries, fruits, and grains, adding bugs and mollusks and netting or snaring birds, fish, rats, rabbits, and other tuskless small fry to up the protein. And we didn’t even work hard at it — much less hard than peasants slaving in somebody else’s field after agriculture was invented, much less hard than paid workers since civilization was invented. The average prehistoric person could make a nice living in about a fifteen-hour work week.\n\nFifteen hours a week for subsistence leaves a lot of time for other things. So much time that maybe the restless ones who didn’t have a baby around to enliven their life, or skill in making or cooking or singing, or very interesting thoughts to think, decided to slope off and hunt mammoths. The skillful hunters would come staggering back with a load of meat, a lot of ivory, and a story. It wasn’t the meat that made the difference. It was the story.\n\nIt is hard to tell a really gripping tale of how I wrestled a wild-oat seed from its husk, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then I scratched my gnat bites, and Ool said something funny, and we went to the creek and got a drink and watched newts for a while, and then I found another patch of oats.... No, it does not compare, it cannot compete with how I thrust my spear deep into the titanic hairy flank while Oob, impaled on one huge sweeping tusk, writhed screaming, and blood sprouted everywhere in crimson torrents, and Boob was crushed to jelly when the mammoth fell on him as I shot my unerring arrow straight through eye to brain.\n\nThat story not only has Action, it has a Hero. Heroes are powerful. Before you know it, the men and women in the wild-oat patch and their kids and the skills of makers and the thoughts of the thoughtful and the songs of the singers are all part of it, have all been pressed into service in the tale of the Hero. But it isn’t their story. It’s his.\n\nWhen she was planning the book that ended up as _Three Guineas_, Virginia Woolf wrote a heading in her notebook, “Glossary”; she had thought of reinventing English according to her new plan, in order to tell a different story. One of the entries in this glossary is _heroism_, defined as “botulism.” And _hero_, in Woolf’s dictionary, is “bottle.” The hero as bottle, a stringent reevaluation. I now propose the bottle as hero.\n\nNot just the bottle of gin or wine, but bottle in its older sense of container in general, a thing that holds something else.\n\nIf you haven’t got something to put it in, food will escape you — even something as uncombative and unresourceful as an oat. You put as many as you can into your stomach while they are handy, that being the primary container; but what about tomorrow morning when you wake up and it’s cold and raining and wouldn’t it be good to have just a few handfuls of oats to chew on and give little Oom to make her shut up, but how do you get more than one stomachful and one handful home? So you get up and go to the damned soggy oat patch in the rain, and wouldn’t it be a good thing if you had something to put Baby Oo Oo in so that you could pick the oats with both hands? A leaf a gourd shell a net a bag a sling a sack a bottle a pot a box a container. A holder. A recipient.\n\n\u003e The first cultural device was probably a recipient.... Many theorizers feel that the earliest cultural inventions must have been a container to hold gathered products and some kind of sling or net carrier.\n\nSo says Elizabeth Fisher in _Women’s Creation_ (McGraw-Hill, 1975). But no, this cannot be. Where is that wonderful, big, long, hard thing, a bone, I believe, that the Ape Man first bashed somebody in the movie and then, grunting with ecstasy at having achieved the first proper murder, flung up into the sky, and whirling there it became a space ship thrusting its way into the cosmos to fertilize it and produce at the end of the movie a lovely fetus, a boy of course, drifting around the Milky Way without (oddly enough) any womb, any matrix at all? I don’t know. I don’t even care. I’m not telling that story. We’ve heard it, we’ve all heard about all the sticks and spears and swords, the things to bash and poke and hit with, the long, hard things, but we have not heard about the thing to put things in, the container for the thing contained. That is a new story. That is news.\n\nAnd yet old. Before — once you think about it, surely long before — the weapon, a late, luxurious, superfluous tool; long before the useful knife and ax; right along with the indispensable whacker, grinder, and digger — for what’s the use of digging up a lot of potatoes if you have nothing to lug the ones you can’t eat home in — with or before the tool that forces energy outward, we made the tool that brings energy home. It makes sense to me. I am an adherent of what Fisher calls the Carrier Bag Theory of human evolution.\n\nThis theory not only explains large areas of theoretical obscurity and avoids large areas of theoretical nonsense (inhabited largely by tigers, foxes, and other highly territorial mammals); it also grounds me, personally, in human culture in a way I never felt grounded before. So long as culture was explained as originating from and elaborating upon the use of long, hard objects for sticking, bashing, and killing, I never thought that I had, or wanted, any particular share in it. (“What Freud mistook for her lack of civilization is woman’s lack of _loyalty_ to civilization,” Lillian Smith observed.) The society, the civilization they were talking about, these theoreticians, was evidently theirs; they owned it, they liked it; they were human, fully human, bashing, sticking, thrusting, killing. Wanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but if that’s what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then evidently I was either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all.\n\nThat’s right, they said. What you are is a woman. Possibly not human at all, certainly defective. Now be quiet while we go on telling the Story of the Ascent of Man the Hero.\n\nGo on, say I, wandering off towards the wild oats, with Oo Oo in the sling and little Oom carrying the basket. You just go on telling how the mammoth fell on Boob and how Cain fell on Abel and how the bomb fell on Nagasaki and how the burning jelly fell on the villagers and how the missiles will fall on the Evil Empire, and all the other steps in the Ascent of Man.\n\nIf it is a human thing to do to put something you want, because it’s useful, edible, or beautiful, into a bag, or a basket, or a bit of rolled bark or leaf, or a net woven of your own hair, or what have you, and then take it home with you, home being another, larger kind of pouch or bag, a container for people, and then later on you take it out and eat it or share it or store it up for winter in a solider container or put it in the medicine bundle or the shrine or the museum, the holy place, the area that contains what is sacred, and then next day you probably do much the same again — if to do that is human, if that’s what it takes, then I am a human being after all. Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time.\n\nNot, let it be said at once, an unaggressive or uncombative human being. I am an aging, angry woman laying mightily about me with my handbag, fighting hoodlums off. However I don’t, nor does anybody else, consider myself heroic for doing so. It’s just one of those damned things you have to do in order to be able to go on gathering wild oats and telling stories.\n\nIt is the story that makes the difference. It is the story that hid my humanity from me, the story the mammoth hunters told about bashing, thrusting, raping, killing, about the Hero. The wonderful, poisonous story of Botulism. The killer story.\n\nIt sometimes seems that the story is approaching its end. Lest there be no more telling of stories at all, some of us out here in the wild oats, amid the alien corn, think we’d better start telling another one, which maybe people can go on with when the old one’s finished. Maybe. The trouble is, we’ve all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. Hence it is with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the untold one, the life story.\n\nIt’s unfamiliar, it doesn’t come easily, thoughtlessly, to the lips as the killer story does; but still, “untold” was an exaggeration. People have been telling the life story for ages, in all sorts of words and ways. Myths of creation and transformation, trickster stories, folktales, jokes, novels....\n\nThe novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story. Of course the Hero has frequently taken it over, that being his imperial nature and uncontrollable impulse, to take everything over and run it while making stern decrees and laws to control his uncontrollable impulse to kill it. So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the arrow or spear, starting _here_ and going straight _there_ and THOK! hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the story isn’t any good if he isn’t in it.\n\nI differ with all of this. I would go so far as to say that the natural, proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us.\n\nOne relationship among elements in the novel may well be that of conflict, but the reduction of narrative to conflict is absurd. (I have read a how-to-write manual that said, “A story should be seen as a battle,” and went on about strategies, attacks, victory, etc.) Conflict, competition, stress, struggle, etc., within the narrative conceived as carrier bag/belly/box/house/medicine bundle, may be seen as necessary elements of a whole which itself cannot be characterized either as conflict or as harmony, since its purpose is neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process.\n\nFinally, it’s clear that the Hero does not look well in this bag. He needs a stage or a pedestal or a pinnacle. You put him in a bag and he looks like a rabbit, like a potato.\n\nThat is why I like novels: instead of heroes they have people in them.\n\nSo, when I came to write science-fiction novels, I came lugging this great heavy sack of stuff, my carrier bag full of wimps and klutzes, and tiny grains of things smaller than a mustard seed, and intricately woven nets which when laboriously unknotted are seen to contain one blue pebble, an imperturbably functioning chronometer telling the time on another world, and a mouse’s skull; full of beginnings without ends, of initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and far more tricks than conflicts, far fewer triumphs than snares and delusions; full of space ships that get stuck, missions that fail, and people who don’t understand. I said it was hard to make a gripping tale of how we wrested the wild oats from their husks, I didn’t say it was impossible. Who ever said writing a novel was easy?\n\nIf science fiction is the mythology of modern technology, then its myth is tragic. “Technology,” or “modern science” (using the words as they are usually used, in an unexamined shorthand standing for the “hard” sciences and high technology founded upon continuous economic growth), is a heroic undertaking, Herculean, Promethean, conceived as triumph, hence ultimately as tragedy. The fiction embodying this myth will be, and has been, triumphant (Man conquers earth, space, aliens, death, the future, etc.) and tragic (apocalypse, holocaust, then or now).\n\nIf, however, one avoids the linear, progressive, Time’s-(killing)-arrow mode of the Techno-Heroic, and redefines technology and science as primarily cultural carrier bag rather than weapon of domination, one pleasant side effect is that science fiction can be seen as a far less rigid, narrow field, not necessarily Promethean or apocalyptic at all, and in fact less a mythological genre than a realistic one.\n\nIt is a strange realism, but it is a strange reality.\n\nScience fiction properly conceived, like all serious fiction, however funny, is a way of trying to describe what is in fact going on, what people actually do and feel, how people relate to everything else in this vast stack, this belly of the universe, this womb of things to be and tomb of things that were, this unending story. In it, as in all fiction, there is room enough to keep even Man where he belongs, in his place in the scheme of things; there is time enough to gather plenty of wild oats and sow them too, and sing to little Oom, and listen to Ool’s joke, and watch newts, and still the story isn’t over. Still there are seeds to be gathered, and room in the bag of stars.\n\n\n---\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/Cognitive-Dissonance":{"title":"Cognitive Dissonance","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":["beliefs","psych"]},"/private/.notes/Columnist":{"title":"Columnist","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":["stub"]},"/private/.notes/Confirmation-Bias":{"title":"Confirmation Bias","content":"\n[[Everything You Know Is Wrong]]\n[[We believe what we want to believe]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":["psych","beliefs"]},"/private/.notes/Consumerism":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\ntags : society, phil\n---\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/Core-Tenets":{"title":"Core Tenets - Mental Health","content":"\n1.

But mostly people who aren't in distress currently\n\u003eand people who dissociate/zone out a lot, and over-workers. \n \nYou know when you've worked your ass off and you achieve something? Before you can even appreciate yourself for it, you're onto the next task, the next goal, the next destination. \n\nWe've all heard \"It's the journey, not the destination\". It's one of those aphorisms I scoff at. _But it is true._\nDestination mindset can be because of the kind of world we live in, hyper-competitive, #hustle and sigma grindset world. It can also be the result of a childhood where you had to constantly prove your worth, a childhood where perfectionism was not just a mere coping mechanism, but a survival mechanism. High expectations, parents you can never please, all that jazz. You didn't and don't deserve that though. You deserve to take a break. Taking a break does not make you lazy. [[Laziness|You Are Not Lazy]]. \n\nI digress, but let's come back to the topic on hand. ***Destination Mindset***. Talking and writing about this makes me feel like one of those lifestyle bloggers, ones who write about zen or whatever word is fancy. \"Mindfulness\" sounds like one of those terms too, and it quite honestly is. It's one of the hottest words right now. \n\n  \u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/3045_RC01/embed_loader.js\"\u003e\n  \u003c/script\u003e\n  \n  \u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\"\u003e\n    trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(\"TIMESERIES\", {\"comparisonItem\":[{\"keyword\":\"mindfulness\",\"geo\":\"\",\"time\":\"2004-01-01 2022-07-30\"}],\"category\":0,\"property\":\"\"}, {\"exploreQuery\":\"date=all\u0026q=mindfulness\",\"guestPath\":\"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/\"});\n  \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003csmall\u003e Interest over time for 'mindfulness' (Google Trends, 2004 - July 2022) \u003c/small\u003e\n\nWant to sell something? Slap on \"mindfulness\" for extra points. \n\nBut no, when I talk to mindfulness, I'm usually referring to the Marsha Linehan's version, which is heavily borrowed from Buddhism among other things. In short, it is a core component of DBT and it means to bring your mind back to the present moment. And not judge your thoughts. \n\nSounds simple, right? Like, pfft, EVERYONE knows that! Everyone does, they do understand the concept but to foster the habit, to cultivate mindfulness? That's hard. I have ADHD, I dissociate A LOT, and a whole lot of other fun stuff. Meditation makes me feel worse for some reason. It wasn't easy for me to get started on this journey of mindfulness, and I've barely even started the journey. But I do promise that mindfulness helps. One of the reasons it took me so long was the internal resistance. I thought the concept was stupid, that it's just one of those things that people say. \"Oh, have you tried yoga?\" or \"Oh, you should get out more I think\". \n\nDestination Mindset is the constant focus on getting somewhere and forgetting to appreciate where we are. It's completely natural. The system \"awards\" constant effort, no breaks, etc. It reinforces it every single time. But no, the journey is as important as the destination. Probably more. Take a moment to celebrate yourself. (Ugh I feel like one of those fake, shallow lifestyle bloggers again, gross.)\n\n\nThis ties in with another important part of DBT, gratitude. Gratitude is hard when you're in a shitty place. It's almost impossible. But when you are in a relatively okay place, you should definitely start practicing gratitude. You don't even have to maintain a fancy gratitude journal. Just try to enjoy the coffee you're sipping. When was the last time you took the time out and enjoyed a meal? Half the times, I don't know what I'm eating. It's like things happen, but they don't register in my head. \n\nFuck what it ought to be, what it can be, what it should have been; fuck the destination. Wherever you go, there you are. And you have the right to stop and sniff the flowers. Will you enjoy it? Maybe. Maybe not. But don't deprive yourself of the opportunity and most importantly, DON'T BE HARSH ON YOURSELF IF YOU CAN'T ENJOY SIMPLE THINGS BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU'RE IN. It's natural. Asking someone to be thankful for their coffee when the world is on fire sounds stupid, and it is stupid. But be kind to yourself, and try to be more present, more in the moment.","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":["mindfulness","reflections","psych","mentalhealth"]},"/private/.notes/Digital-Gardens":{"title":"Digital Gardens","content":"\n\nMeowwww test test\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/Dissociation":{"title":"Dissociation","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":["psych","mentalhealth"]},"/private/.notes/Distortions":{"title":"Cognitive Distortions","content":"\n\nThere are more distortions than I can possibly cover in one post, but I did my best to highlight the most common ones. REMEMBER, these aren't grounds for dismissing your feelings. Your feelings are valid. They were, are, and will always be. This is something for YOU to be able to recognise unhelpful patterns and fight them.  \n  \nEveryone has cognitive distortions. Your cognitive distortions aren't your fault. It isn't your fault that you were dealt with situations where the brain had to adopt such behaviours, such styles of thinking. Be easy on yourself, you deserve that much ♥\n\n### What are cognitive distortions?\nThey are patterns of thinking that are negative and \"irrational\". Unhelpful thinking patterns. Again, reminder that these thought patterns probably evolved as a response to trauma, so please be kind to yourself.\n\n\n### Types of Cognitive Distortions\nAll-or-Nothing Thinking: You see things in black and white categories. If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.\nOver Generalization: You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.\n\nMental Filter: You pick out a single negative detail and dwePell on it exclusively so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that discolors the entire beaker of water.\n\nDisqualifying the Positive: You reject positive experiences by insisting they \"don't count\" for some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your everyday experiences.\n\nJumping to Conclusion: You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support you conclusions.\nMind Reading: You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you, and you don't bother to check this out.\n\nThe Fortune Teller Error: You anticipate that things will turn out badly, and you feel convinced that your prediction is an established fact.\nMagnification (catastrophizing) or Minimization: You exaggerate the importance of things, or you inappropriately shrink things until the appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or the other fellow's imperfections).\n\nEmotional Reasoning: You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: \"I feel it, therefore it must be true\".\n\nShould Statements: You try to motivate yourself with should and shouldn't, as if you\nhad to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything. \n\"Musts\" and \"oughts\" are also offenders. The emotional consequences is guilt. When you direct should statements toward others you feel anger, frustration, and resentment.\n\nLabeling and Mislabeling: This is an extreme form of over generalization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: \"I’m a loser\". When someone else's behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to them.\n\nPersonalization: You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event which in fact you were not primarily responsible for.","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":["psych","tools"]},"/private/.notes/Everything-You-Know-Is-Wrong":{"title":"Everything You Know Is Wrong","content":"\n\nThings that'll shake your beliefs\nvvv existential \nwill make you rethink a lot of things\n\n#blog\n\nexamples/content - \na.

A reanalysis of Study 1 showed that the energy effect is not simply a case of consumers using more energy when they have more energy, because the energy effect disappeared when participants were made aware of the energy source, suggesting that a preference-correction process occurred.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":["bias","psych"]},"/private/.notes/Inertia":{"title":"Inertia","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":["mentalhealth","psych"]},"/private/.notes/Inner-Child":{"title":"Inner Child","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":["mentalhealth","psych"]},"/private/.notes/InternetAddiction":{"title":"Internet Addiction and My Battle With It","content":"\n\n\n\nInternet addiction is a real thing, folks.

LOC basically is how you view control over your own life. People either have an internal LOC where they believe they have the power to control thier own lives, or an external LOC where you believe everything in life comes from a source other than yourself (I got fired because my boss hates me, I was late because traffic...etc.). Now, what's interesting is that studies have shown people with an internal LOC find greater satisfaction and success in almost every aspect of life.....except one......being in a nursing home. Drives internal LOC people CRAZY while external LOC people thrive\n\n**When something goes wrong, it’s natural to cast blame on the perceived cause of the misfortune. Where an individual casts that blame can be related, in many cases, to a psychological construct known as “locus of control.”**\n\nJulian B.

In 1966, Rotter created a 13-item forced-choice scale in order to measure locus of control\n\n\nMost people have either an internal or external [locus of control.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ulterior-motives/201402/control-and-health) Those with an internal locus of control believe that their actions matter, and they are the authors of their own destiny.

YOU ARE NOT LAZY. \n\nDifferent tasks need different amount of energy, right? And different people need different amounts of energy for the same task. Sounds like such a fundamentally simple concept but people don't seem to recognize this. \n\nAnd for a lot of us, the amount of mental work we constantly do is enough to tire us out. This can look like laziness to others, but it is not. \n\n### What about stuff like \"[[Secondary Gain]]\"?\nTo those who aren't familiar with the term, it basically means that people who are in a bad place, disabled, injured, or whatever, they might have less incentive to get better because of the sympathy, attention, and other ✨amazing benefits✨they get. This might be true, but it is not always the case. In my experience, it's often not the case at all! Just go online and look at the number of people who are invalidating themselves (not their fault) and thinking they're faking their illness. Impostor syndrome in mental illness and sufferring too. \"Maybe I'm just being extra?\" \"Maybe I did all of this for attention?\" \n\nAnd even if it is true, what use is it if it causes more harm than good? People who are already traumatized go harder on themselves because of ableist bullshit like this. \n\nAre you saying that I enjoy the \"attention\" I get by not doing my work? You're right. As much as I enjoy having anxiety attacks, crying, and panicking over the same unfinished work. It's easier to do the work than go through this hell. It is easier to go through shit and get it done than faking an illness, having breakdowns, and being hyper-aware of the consequences of my actions. Why don't I just do it then? Definitely not because there's a road block in my head. It's because I'm lazy AND I enjoy this, duh!\n\nRead also [[Spoon Theory]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/Libre":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\ntags: computer, tech, web, phil\n---\n\nsee also: [[Open Source]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/Linehan":{"title":"Marsha Linehan","content":"\n\nMarsha Linehan - Author of DBT \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":["people","author"]},"/private/.notes/Marketing":{"title":"Marketing","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/McFeely":{"title":"McFeely","content":"\nIt's nearly 5 AM, so I will aim for neither eloquence or style. I don't quite remember when I found out about Mr Rogers, quite possibly two years ago, or maybe more. Time seems to be a weird concept, doubly when you're in the middle of what seems to be a ceaseless pandemic.\n\nI was up, reading statistics and news about the virus (would definitely not recommend that. Wasn't my first time, won't be my last). Nothing soothes my anxiety like some freshly baked numbers and research articles that affirm your worst fears. **I hate that I do this despite knowing well about my anxiety, but that's the nature of anxiety; pervasive and enduring, playing both the firestarter and the forest fire that burns down the woods of my sanity. I need to seek information to make sure I'm prepared, but that very information causes more anxiety**\n\nI digress, but trying to get back to the topic of today's ramblings - Mr Rogers. I get distressed A LOT. Sometimes, very few times,(times when I'm not numb because of the bottling up, or the times when I'm not rolled into a tear-spewing ball) I look at work by Mr Rogers. And boy does it help!\n\nFor those of you who aren't familiar with him - He's probably the nicest well-known person to ever exist. He quells the fiery rage in me, soothes the child in me, and reminds me of the importance of kindness. Cheesy, I know.\n\nMr Rogers was a TV show host. A kids' TV show host at that. \n\n\"Pfft, why aren't you over a kids' TV show host, you're 21!\" \n\nWell... because he wasn't just any TV show host, he was this Presbyterian minister who didn't like what was displayed on kids television shows, so he went out to change that.\n\n\"Umm. Isn't shitting on religious conservatives who are offended by innocuous things YOUR THING? Basically, your favourite hobby?\"\na) That isn't my favourite hobby, that's my second favourite one. \nb) Shame on you for jumping to conclusions and thinking that Christian minister = conservative, and for discarding his ideas just because of his beliefs.\n\n\"But, I'm just reading what you wrote! I'm one of your voice-\"\n\nAnyway, with all the distractions now gone, let's get back. **Fred Rogers**. A man who wanted to do something to change how kids' programmes were violent, mindless, and provided no value. My initial knee-jerk reaction to this was \"OMG, don't kill the fun!\", but then I saw the things he accomplished. Most notably, Mr Rogers' Neighborhood. Imagine the coziest, fluffiest, warmest thing you can. That's Mr Rogers' Neighbourhood.\n\nI can't do it justice, so I'll simply direct you to https://www.misterrogers.org/our-television-neighbor/.\n\nAnd for the lazy ones, here's an excerpt that does more justice than I did, but still not enough justice - _Over more than 30 years Mister Rogers created a relationship with millions of children, each of whom felt like they were visiting with a trusted friend. Mister Rogers looked directly into the camera and sang and talked to each child watching. His radical kindness, acceptance, and empathy created a place that as TV Guide described: “ **makes us, young and old alike, feel safe, cared for and valued… Wherever Mister Rogers is, so is sanctuary.**”\n\nWow, so I can't believe I just spent the entire time JUST trying to introduce Mister Rogers and still butchering it.\n\nBut anyway, I _adore_ Mr Rogers. I've never been the kind of person to have a role model. (Don't put people on a pedestal, right?) I never really found anyone who was amazing enough to be role model material, you know? But Mr Rogers? Him I can confidently call my role model.\n\nWhy did his work resonate so much with me? Because... Our beliefs were aligned! When I was around 15, I was struck by what I called an epiphany but now call common sense. I came to the (not so) startling conclusion that most \"bad behaviour\", as I termed it then, could be traced back to a bad childhood. I postulated that most crimes happen because of fucked up childhoods. Of course, it is more nuanced than that, but it really does hold true to a certain extent. Childhood shapes us. It's the most important part of our lives, but I feel like we don't give it enough importance. Kids will be kids. No! They'll grow up to be ill-functioning caffeine-addicted adults someday!\n\nMr Rogers understood this. He understood the importance of love and empathy. Of kindness. Of self-acceptance. On his show, he made sure that everyone felt like they had a friend. He extended love.\n\nBut that's not it. It wasn't just the fact that I shared his view, or the general altruistic feel-goodness that made me connect with Mister Rogers. It was something more personal. He told me things I've always wanted to hear. It might sound weird to picture a grown-ass adult crying at Mr Rogers singing \"It's you I like\", but I found out I wasn't the only one. I introduced it to my then-partner and they did the same. Both of us had a fragmented childhood and it just hit us right in the feels. Do yourself a favour and listen to it. https://misterrogers.org/videos/its-you-i-like/\n\nLook at the lyrics and tell me you didn't feel a thing -\n\nIt's you I like, It's not the things you wear, It's not the way you do your hair-- But it's you I like. The way you are right now, The way down deep inside you-- Not the things that hide you, Not your toys-- They're just beside you.\n\nBut it's you I like-- Every part of you, Your skin, your eyes, your feelings Whether old or new. I hope that you'll remember Even when you're feeling blue That it's you I like, It's you yourself, It's you, it's you I like.\n\n(It's okay if the lyrics didn't do anything to you, Mister Rogers loves you regardless)\n\nMr Rogers was the father I never had. The friend I never had. But the one all of us need, especially in these bleak times. His show wasn't just some silly show, the little details that make up the show are just so beautiful; I urge you to explore.\n\nHe covered serious issues. From divorce to death and everything in between, Mister Rogers talked about, gently. In a way that a child can understand. He helped them process their feelings. “Whatever is mentionable can be more manageable.” Mr Rogers normalised so many things and made help more accessible.\n\n\"He understood that new experiences or changes in routine can feel overwhelming and scary to young children. He showed us what to expect. He reassured us. He prepared us to meet and trust the people who would care for us – the doctor, the dentist, the barber, the teacher.\" He'd cover things most people would deem mundane, things most networks would take a hard pass on.\n\nHe treated children with respect and saw them as equals; he didn't patronise them. He actually listened.\n\nThe best part? The lessons he taught aren't exclusively for children. A lot of us could use them too. They're cathartic, trust me.\n\nI have a large collection of Mister Rogers quotes, but I'll leave you with these.\n\n\u003e “Everyone longs to be loved. And the greatest thing we can do is to let people know that they are loved and capable of loving.”\n\n\u003e \"Imagine what our real neighborhoods would be like if each of us offered, as a matter of course, just one kind word to another person.\"\n\n**I never thought I'd quote Tommy Wiseau in a post about Fred Rogers, but - \"If a lot of people love each other, the world would be a better place to live.\"** True Tommy, I'm with you on that. If only everyone were more true to their feelings. But maybe we'll get there!\nI'll wind up this needlessly lengthy post that didn't manage to capture an ounce of the legacy that Mr Rogers has left with a quote that I really love and find comforting.\n\n\u003e _“**When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, “Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.”**_\n\nLook for the helpers. Not to be dramatic, but this phrase sorta reignited my faith in humanity, kinda helped me view everything a bit differently, you know?\n\nThank you, Fred McFeely Rogers. Thank you for reminding me of the oath I took as a kid. To spread love, respect, and happiness no matter what. I have faltered, I have gone astray, but I am giving it my best.","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":["wholesome","people","blog"]},"/private/.notes/Money-is-the-root":{"title":"Money is the root","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/Mood-Thought-Diary":{"title":"Mood Thought Diary","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/ObjectConstancy":{"title":"Object Constancy","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/Occams-Razor":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\ntags : razor, phil, adages, tools\n---\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/Ontological-Parasite":{"title":"Ontological Parasite","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.511656464Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/Open-Source":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\ntags: computer, tech, web, phil\n---\n\nsee also : [[Libre]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.5156565Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/Perceived-threat":{"title":"Perceived threat","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.5156565Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/Philosophies":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\ntitle : Philosophies and Concepts That Have Changed My Life\ntags : razor, phil, adages, tools\n---\n\n\n- [[Libre]] - *Free as in Freedom* \n- [[Digital Gardens]]\n- [[mindfulness]] \n- [[feminism]] and [[intersectionalism]]\n- \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.5156565Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/Poes-Law":{"title":"Poe's Law","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.5156565Z","tags":["tools","adages"]},"/private/.notes/Prenatal":{"title":"Prenatal","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.5156565Z","tags":["stub"]},"/private/.notes/Quotes":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\nTitle : 'My Favourite Quotes'\ntags : quotes\n---\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.5156565Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/Rehabilitation":{"title":"Rehabilitation over Punishment","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.5156565Z","tags":["soc","psych","phil","reframe"]},"/private/.notes/Research-Methodologies":{"title":"Research Methodologies","content":"\n==using known information to find unknown\nnew information==\n\n- is scientific\n- any branch of knowledge\n- rational\n- based on facts, rooted in reality \n\n\n\n\n- \"systemized way to gain new information\" - \n- \"movement from known to unknown\"\n- problem to conclusion\n\n## Definition\n*Comprises of defining, redefining*\n*manipulation of situation, control the env/variables*\n\n## Variables and \n\n## Objective of Research / Motivation\n1.

The power of prayer?\"\n\nI'm becoming aware that I'm staring, I'm like a rabbit  \nSuddenly trapped in the blinding headlights of vacuous crap.  \nMaybe it's the Hamlet she just misquothed  \nOr the sixth glass of wine I just quaffed  \nBut my diplomacy dike groans  \nAnd the arsehole held back by its stones can be held back no more:\n\n\"Look, Storm,  \nSorry I don't mean to bore you but there's no such thing as an aura!  \nReading Auras is like reading minds or  \nTea-leaves or star-signs or meridian lines  \nThese people aren't applying a skill,  \nThey're either lying or mentally ill.  \nSame goes for people who claim they hear God's demands  \nAnd spiritual healers who think they've magic hands.\n\nBy the way, why do we think it's okay for  \nPeople to pretend they can talk to the dead?  \nIsn't that totally fucked in the head?  \nLying to some crying woman whose child has died  \nAnd telling her you're in touch with the other side?  \nI think that's fundamentally sick  \nDo we need to clarify here that there's no such thing as a psychic?\n\nWhat are we, fucking two?  \nDo we actually think that Horton Heard a Who?  \nDo we still believe that Santa brings us gifts?  \nThat Michael Jackson didn't have facelifts?  \nAre we still so stunned by circus tricks that we think  \nThat the dead would wanna talk to pricks like John Edwards?\n\nStorm to her credit despite my derision keeps firing off clichés  \nWith startling precision like a sniper using bollocks for ammunition\n\n\"You're so sure of your position but you're just closed-minded  \nI think you'll find that your faith in science and  \nTests is just as blind as the faith of any fundamentalist\"\n\n\"Wow that's a good point, let me think for a bit.  \nOh wait, my mistake, that's absolute bullshit.  \nScience adjusts it's views based on what's observed.  \nFaith is the denial of observation so that Belief can be preserved.  \nIf you show me that, say, homeopathy works, then I will change my mind  \nI'll spin on a fucking dime  \nI'll be embarrassed as hell,  \nBut I will run through the streets yelling  \n'It's a miracle!

Over time, this practice—even if you only engage in it occasionally—can help you change your relationship with food to one that is more present-centered, satisfying, and healthier.\" \n\n**Mini-Mindfulness Practices**\n\nAlthough multitasking may be unavoidable at times, the daily experience of pressure to “get things done” unconsciously ensnares many people in its gravitational pull. Multitasking frequently becomes standard operating procedure, even when it isn’t necessary.\n\n1.  Strive to minimize multitasking and do one thing at a time; be present with the task at hand, giving it your undiluted [attention](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention \"Psychology Today looks at attention\").\n2.  Do it deliberately and without rushing—even (and perhaps especially) if you feel pressure—external or internal—to do so. As John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach, regularly instructed his players, “Be quick, but don’t hurry.”\n3.  Do it to completion.\n4.  space—even a brief pause—between the activities in which you engage rather than going directly from one task to the next.\n5.  yourself permission to do less than what you may have planned or what your thinking says you “should do” or “have to do.”\n6.  Each time you scroll through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or other social media platforms, pause on a random name (be it someone you know or not) and take a moment to wish that person well—perhaps literally saying to yourself: __________, may you be well. May you be at peace.\n7.  As you wake up from sleep, take a moment while [lying](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/deception \"Psychology Today looks at lying\") in bed with your eyes open and express appreciation for the gift of waking up to another day. Not everyone receives this gift.\n8.  When you first step outside in the morning, take a few seconds to observe—without judgment—the sights and sounds of your neighborhood.\n9.  When you approach a window in your home or office, take a few moments to pause, look through it, and really notice what you see.\n\n**Mindful Eating**\n\nMany people, both in and out of recovery, eat emotionally—that is, they eat in response to stress or emotional discomfort ([anxiety](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety \"Psychology Today looks at anxiety\"), [fear](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear \"Psychology Today looks at fear\"), [loneliness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/loneliness \"Psychology Today looks at loneliness\"), [boredom](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/boredom \"Psychology Today looks at boredom\"), [anger](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger \"Psychology Today looks at anger\"), or sadness). Sometimes, this is also an attempt to fill a sense of internal emptiness. When people behave this way, they eat without thinking about what or why they’re eating; they may not even taste the food, which they chew quickly and incompletely. Have you ever finished eating something only to realize you don’t know how it tasted?\n\nMindful eating is the antithesis of [stressed](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress \"Psychology Today looks at stressed\") or [emotional eating](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/appetite \"Psychology Today looks at emotional eating\") and the antidote for it. Mindful eating means paying conscious attention to the experience of eating using all the senses. It emphasizes the awareness of taste, as well as colors, textures, smells, and sounds, during the process of eating. For instance, when mindfully eating an apple, you might notice the color, feel how smooth it is, take in its fragrance, listen to what it sounds like when you bite into it, and taste it fully, one bite at a time.\n\n1.  Before you eat, bring your awareness to the activity. Are you actually hungry and need nourishment in preparation for some activity, or are you eating out of some sort of emotional dis-ease?\n2.  As much as possible, try to eat before you get to the point of being extremely hungry.\n3.  Take two or three deep breaths to relax and connect your mind with your body.\n4.  Appreciate the food you’re getting ready to eat.\n5.  Consider what it took to get that food from its origins to your table.\n6.  As you eat, notice the aroma(s), texture(s), and color(s) of your food.\n7.  Take one bite at a time, tasting it fully.\n8.  Chew your food carefully, savoring it.\n9.  Swallow it slowly.\n10.  Wait until you’ve completely swallowed one bite of your food before taking the next one.\n11.  Pause briefly and take an intentional breath—in and out—between swallowing and taking that next bite.\n12.  As you eat, remind yourself to breathe.\n13.  Pay attention to when you feel satisfied or beginto feel “full.”\n14.  Stop eating when you reach this point, rather than continuing to eat until you feel “stuffed” and uncomfortable.\n15.  If there is food left, store it for another time.\n16.  Notice how you feel when you are finished eating.\n\nBy making the experience of taking food and drink into the body much more conscious, eating mindfully slows the process of ingesting, tasting, chewing, and swallowing. The intent is to pay close and careful attention to the sensory aspects of your food and the process of eating and to eat deliberately rather than unconsciously shoveling food into your face. The result is that you will eat more slowly, taste your food more thoroughly, chew your food more completely, and swallow it more patiently.\n\nAll of this contributes to healthier digestion. Over time, this practice—even if you only engage in it occasionally—can help you change your relationship with food to one that is more present-centered, satisfying, and healthier.\n\nCopyright 2019 Dan Mager, MSW \n[[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/some-assembly-required/201904/mindfulness-is-much-more-meditation]]\n\n---\n\nMindfulness is a state of active, open [attention](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/attention \"Psychology Today looks at attention\") to the present. This state is described as observing one’s thoughts and feelings without judging them as good or bad.\n\nThe emergence of mindfulness in Western culture can be attributed to Jon Kabat-Zinn. Kabat-Zinn studied mindfulness under several Buddhist teachers, such as Philip Kapleau and Thich Nhat Hanh. As a professor at the University of Massachusetts medical school in the late 1970s, Kabat-Zinn developed a program called Mindfulness-Based [Stress](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/stress \"Psychology Today looks at Stress\") Reduction (MBSR) to treat [chronic pain](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/chronic-pain \"Psychology Today looks at chronic pain\"). He discovered that patients would often try to avoid pain—but that that avoidance would lead to deeper distress. Practicing mindfulness was a more successful approach.\n\n### What is mindfulness?\n\nMindfulness encompasses two key ingredients: [awareness and acceptance.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/201502/what-is-mindfulness-and-how-does-it-work)\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/mindfulness\n\n\n---\nSpradlin (2003) adapts DBT’s “what” skills of mindfulness to help us begin the journey of practicing mindful awareness: \n### **Observe:**\n\n-   Start to simply _notice_ your environment, thoughts, feelings, and sensations without _reacting_ to them\n-   Observe the emotion you are feeling or the thought you are having\n-   Simply see it there before you, without adding anything to it, judging it, or trying to change it\n-   Avoid reacting to your emotions – say to yourself,”I notice that I feel love/anger/joy”\n-   Allow your thoughts, feelings, and sensations to come and go (as they all _do_) – control your _attention_, not _what_ you see\n-   Push nothing away (no matter how uncomfortable/painful) and cling to nothing (no matter how enjoyable/pleasant)\n-   Be _alert_ to all that enters your experience – every thought, feeling, and sensation\n-   Pay close attention to the input you receive from all 5 senses: sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste\n\n### **Describe:**\n\n-   Now that you have observed, use _words_ to practice describing your internal experience\n-   Stay descriptive and simple\n-   If you have been taught to ignore/belittle emotions, it can be difficult to be attentive and mindful to your experience\n-   If you have difficulty, or if this feels unnatural, simply say to yourself, “I notice that I’m feeling self-conscious right now”\n-   If you’re feeling frustrated or anxious, say to yourself, “I notice how my thoughts are coming very quickly right now”\n\n### **Participate:**\n\n-   With practice, mindfulness will allow you to more fully _participate_ in your own life and experiences\n-   Mindfulness will allow you to _fully engage_ in every experience without needing to “love” or “hate” it\n-   Practice simply participating in each moment as it comes – _be here now_\n-   If you need to make plans for the future, then _fully participate_ in making those plans\n-   Allow yourself to be a part of what is happening without obsessing over every detail or becoming self-conscious\n-   Practice _letting go_ of thoughts like “How am I doing?” or “How do I look?”\n\nhttps://www.mindfulnessmuse.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy/dbts-what-skills-of-mindfulness\n\n\n--- \n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.5156565Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/misterrogers":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\ntags : people\n---","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.5156565Z","tags":[]},"/private/.notes/tim-minchin":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\ntags : people\n---\n\n[[Storm - Tim Minchin]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.5156565Z","tags":[]},"/private/config/1-yaml":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\ntitle: \"\u003c% tp.file.title %\u003e\"\ndate: \u003c% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\") %\u003e\n\u003c%* \nvar yaml = '';\n\nvar tArr = tp.file.tags;\n\ntArr.sort();\n\nvar tStr = tArr.join(', ').replace(/#/g,'');\n\nif (tStr.length) {\nyaml = '\\ntags: [' + tStr + ']\\n\\n';\n}\n%\u003e\u003c%* tR += yaml %\u003e\n---","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.519656535Z","tags":[]},"/private/config/date":{"title":"date","content":"\u003c% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\") %\u003e\n\n ","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.519656535Z","tags":[]},"/private/config/legacy":{"title":"legacy","content":"(this is a legacy file;

It is German for *\"slip box\"*. \n- Popularized by Niklas Luhmann[^1]\n- Great for building a [[second brain]] \n- Can help find connections between notes\n- Useful for thinking more broadly by not confining your notes to a subject \n---\n\nSo basically, the Zettelkasten Method relies on interconnectivity of information, and atomicity of concepts. You make notes that work independently. If you feel a connection, you note it down.\n\n## Luhmann's Zettelkasten - The Method in His Words\nLuhmann used a physical box of cards. Made 90,000+ handwritten notes. \nSome of Luhmann's comments on the method (emboldening by me) - \n\n “Underlying the filing technique is the experience that **without writing, there is no thinking.**”\n \n **“I always read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box.”** [2]\n \n “I, of course, do not think everything by myself. It happens mainly within the slip-box.”\n \n (The zettelkasten is a) “combination of disorder and order, of clustering and unpredictable combinations emerging from ad hoc selection.”\n\n\u003e\"Probably the **best method is to take notes – not excerpts, but condensed reformulated accounts of a text**. Rewriting what was already written almost automatically trains one to shift the attention towards frames, patterns and categories in the observations, or the conditions/assumptions, which enable certain, but not other descriptions.”*\n\u003e\n— Niklas Luhmann\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Principles of Zettelkasten\n\n1. Note taking - Take notes. Not excerpts, but how you understand it. In your own words. \n2. Atomicity - *He realised that **one idea, one note was only as valuable as its context**, which was not necessarily the context it was taken from*. So, one idea per note.\n3. Autonomy - Notes should make sense by themselves too. \n4. Connect Notes - Try to link all notes. *\"A note that is not connected to the network will be lost, will be forgotten by the Zettelkasten\"*\n5. Number your notes - use any numbering system and stick to it. It's just a way to identify the cards for linking. The numbers do not mean anything. **The point of the method is not having to worry where a note goes.** \n6. \n\nThe core of the technique lies in a few simple principles:\n- Write liberally about what you think and read. Write in detail so you can quickly re-internalize ideas after you forget them.\n- Wherever you can, separate notes into **small and distinct ideas**.\n- When you notice connections between ideas, encode them by writing references from one note to another.\n- When you want to think or write, read your notes and follow the references between them.\n- Update as you go. Find something new to add? Add it. Don't agree with something you had written once? Don't trash the old note! Make a connection to the new one and explain why you changed your mind. \n---\n\n[^1]: - Niklas Luhmann was a sociologist and a prolific writer having published as many as 70 books and nearly 400 scholarly articles. His main work was in Systems Theory. Luhmann himself described his theory as \"labyrinthine\" or \"non-linear\" and claimed he was deliberately keeping his prose enigmatic to prevent it from being understood \"too quickly\", which would only produce simplistic misunderstandings!\n\n[^2]: - Personal note - This is what helped me the most and why I find this method pretty much life-changing. It has changed the way I process things, the way I learn things. This way, I've been more [[mindfulness|mindful]] of what I'm reading, what is important. As a result, I've been able to retain more. \n","lastmodified":"2023-07-06T21:29:39.519656535Z","tags":["philosophy","tool"]}}
