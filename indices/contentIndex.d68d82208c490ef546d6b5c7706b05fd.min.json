A pale, boring 90 minute distillation of 299 pages. Something a 10 minute summary does a better job of.  \n\n# About \nAuthor: James Joyce\n[[Stream of consciousness]] \n[[Modernist]]\nsemi-autobiographical \ncoming of age\ninner conflict\n\n\n# Summary - Key Events\nStephen Dedalus - as a kid- goes to hostel - is asked by his father not to snitch on anyone - he gets pushed into a ditch - does NOT snitch - while asleep he overhears a conversation -\u003e\n\tabout Parnell (Irish politician, not ficitional) - how he fell due to his sins - adultery (lust) and pride  \n\n**Christmas Dinner** Dedalus goes back home - argument about politics erupts- Simon and Mr Casey (Simon's friend) discuss how the Catholic church should not meddle in politics. **Dante** disagrees. Says its catholics' duty to follow whatever the priests and bishops say without questioning; even if they are opposed to the Irish cause. Says she will defend her religion against \"renegade catholics\" \nMr Casey tells a story - how an old Catholic woman talked ill about Parnell and the woman he cheated with. Mr Casey upon hearing their names bemirched, on hearing the words she used, spits his tobacco juice on her face. The men laugh. Dante is infuriated, calls Mr Casey a blasphemer, and repeatedly says \"may they devil be on you\"\n\n**Secularists vs Orthodox**\n\n**Back to school**\nWe see how the kids are flogged in Catholic school. Dedalus gets flogged because Father Dolan thinks he's being an \"idle loafer\" who isn't working though he can't work due to his glasses being broken. He goes and tells the rector about what Father Dolan did. His classmates hoist him over their heads and celebrate him as a hero.\nThough this happens, Dedalus still feels alone once the wave is gone. He realizes that being a hero will not reduce his \"outsider\"ness or end his loneliness. After meeting the rector, he goes home to get a new pair of glasses. \n\nThe Dedaluses become bankrupt, have to move, and their properties are auctioned off. Stephen and Simon attend it. Simon imparts advice, tells Stephen to associate w gentemen, how all of his friends were good at one thing or the other. He emphasises on how they were truthful \n\nDedalus wins the national essay and is rewarded w money. When his essay is being read, a \"lewd\" picture is being passed along. Uses the money at a brothel. \n\nFather Parnall delivers a speech about hell. About how awful it is. \n\"Fire in hell gives no light\" , bodies stacked upon each other, no space, corpses rotting, putrid stench, millions of carcasses, \ntorment of fire is the worst thing they're subjected to. Fire of Hell was created by God to punish. It preserves what it burns. It burns at the highest intensity. \"Time is time was. Time shall be no more\". Talks about temptation and giving into them. **Stephen is scared.**  He gets nightmares and throws up. \n\nStephen confesses. He tells the father he has slept with prostitutes. And he has impure thoughts. He is asked to not \"offend God again\"  and give up the wretched sin. Pray to Mother Mary when the temptations come. \n\nCalling of God. Promised \"awful\" powers if he becomes a priest. More than any angel or archangel.  \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T12:21:44.082116022Z","tags":null},"/notes/Albert-Bandura":{"title":"Albert Bandura","content":"\n1) Bobo Doll experiment \n2) Observational Learning\n3) Bandura's learning model triangle\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T12:21:44.082116022Z","tags":null},"/notes/America-Allen-Ginsberg":{"title":"America by Allen Ginsberg","content":"\nAmerica by \nAllen Ginsberg - Beat generation poet; \n\n\nAmerica is personified\n\n\u003e [!Poem]-\n\u003e America I’ve given you all and now I’m nothing. \nAmerica two dollars and twentyseven cents January 17, 1956.   \nI can’t stand my own mind.\nAmerica when will we end the human war?\nGo fuck yourself with your atom bomb.\nI don’t feel good don’t bother me.\nI won’t write my poem till I’m in my right mind.\nAmerica when will you be angelic?\nWhen will you take off your clothes?\nWhen will you look at yourself through the grave?\nWhen will you be worthy of your million Trotskyites?\nAmerica why are your libraries full of tears?\nAmerica when will you send your eggs to India?\nI’m sick of your insane demands.\nWhen can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks?\nAmerica after all it is you and I who are perfect not the next world.   \nYour machinery is too much for me.\nYou made me want to be a saint.\nThere must be some other way to settle this argument.   \nBurroughs is in Tangiers I don’t think he’ll come back it’s sinister.   \nAre you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke?   \nI’m trying to come to the point.\nI refuse to give up my obsession.\nAmerica stop pushing I know what I’m doing.\nAmerica the plum blossoms are falling.\nI haven’t read the newspapers for months, everyday somebody goes on trial for murder.\nAmerica I feel sentimental about the Wobblies.\nAmerica I used to be a communist when I was a kid I’m not sorry.   \nI smoke marijuana every chance I get.\nI sit in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet.   \nWhen I go to Chinatown I get drunk and never get laid.   \nMy mind is made up there’s going to be trouble.\nYou should have seen me reading Marx.\nMy psychoanalyst thinks I’m perfectly right.\nI won’t say the Lord’s Prayer.\nI have mystical visions and cosmic vibrations.\nAmerica I still haven’t told you what you did to Uncle Max after he came over from Russia.\nI’m addressing you.\nAre you going to let your emotional life be run by Time Magazine?   \nI’m obsessed by Time Magazine.\nI read it every week.\nIts cover stares at me every time I slink past the corner candystore.   \nI read it in the basement of the Berkeley Public Library.\nIt’s always telling me about responsibility.

Researchers at Wake Forest University found that **trans fats**, which are created by partially hydrogenated oil, increase the amount of fat around the belly and redistribute fat tissue to the abdomen from other parts of the body. Trans fats may be found in such foods as margarine, pastries, cookies, crackers, and fried and convenience foods.\n2. Visceral fat == dangerous\n3. **verify** - *Extended fasting activates autophagy which clears out misfolded proteins and senescent cells in the entire body. HGH and NAD+ are upregulated. It selects for beneficial gut bacteria that not only do less damage to your digestive tract, but also drive healthy behavior via the gut-brain axis. Then you get into the insane mismatch of the promotion of maintenance of steady blood sugar via constant eating and our actual evolutionary history and the concomitant devastation that has on metabolic health.*\n4. **SLEEP IS IMPORTANT**\n5. **Check if strength training thing is true** We lose **muscle mass as we age**. Strength training, such as lifting weights helps us build muscle. Muscles use up more energy and therefore burn more calories. \n   ***Weight training builds muscle, and muscle burns more calories than fat-up to three times more. \"So the more muscle you have, the more calories you're going to burn. It doesn't end after you leave the gym either. Your body is still torching calories for the next 24 to 48 hours as it works to repair stressed muscle tissues. That's known as the afterburn effect, another name for excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). The more oxygen you use both during and after a workout, the greater the EPOC. And studies show strength training is one of the best ways to do it.***\n   6. Cut down on **refined** products. Whole grain \u003e\u003e\u003e\n   7. Add more fiber\n   8.

Self-testing and spreading out study sessions — so-called distributed practice — are excellent ways to improve learning. They are efficient, easy to use and effective.\n3.  Underlining and rereading, two methods that many students use, are ineffective and can be time-consuming.\n4.  Other learning techniques need further testing and evaluation.

The night of that theatrical  \nperformance was his last chance to see that the audience stay  \nawake the entire night while watching his play. We hear  \nauthor-narrator‟s repeated laments,  \n“I may be dead within the next few hours.”  \nMythical elements can be seen in the second and the third  \nnarrative level. The author-narrator meets the host of the  \ngiggling flames, each one carrying her own story becomes the  \nsecond story. These personified flames go to the same ruined  \ntemple where the author-narrator is bewailing his plight.  \nOn the third level, we find a tale by a flame, who wants to be  \nforgiven for arriving late to the hosting place. The tale is about  \nan old woman who knew an interesting story but refused to  \nshare it with others. Ironically, that story slipped out of the  \nsnoring old hag‟s mouth and is transformed into a beautiful  \nyoung lady and the song that accompanies it, turns into a  \nbeautiful sari.\nThus, the fourth narrative level is the story of Rani, the lady  \nwho born out of the story from the old hag‟s mouth. Rani  \nbecomes the main character of the play Nagamandala. As the  \nmain story begins, the complex turn in the structure of the  \nstory can be observed\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T12:21:44.082116022Z","tags":null},"/notes/News-Stories":{"title":"News Stories","content":"\n\n\n**5Ws and 1H** \n**Cause and effect**; after effect\n**Impact** - the effect of the news on people\n**Context** - Background information about an issue\n**Follow up story** - because low attention span; adds information and helps keep a story in the public conscience\n**Emotions** - keep to minimum; factual\n\n## Hard News vs Soft News \n\nHard News - Short, FACTUAL, to the point\nFocuses on impact \nImportant \nUrgent / pressing\n\nSoft News - Unimportant, longer \nniche, \n\n#### Inverted Pyramid\n##### Leads\n\tmaximum amount of information\n\tmain idea and subject\n\tbe clear what the story is all about\n\tgrab attention\n##### Body\n##### Conclusion\n####\n\n**Avoid jargon**, complicated words. \nSurprise them; element of surprise\n\n5 Important aspects \n\nbe clear what the story is all about\ndecide whether hard or soft news\ngrab attention\n\n### Tips \nNews stories should not be very long\nEngage the reader\n\nAttributions and quotations -\u003e very important\nSentences should not be too long\nNot too many punctuations \nText should not look hard to read, or messy\nVoice - Use Active Voice \n\nWords - don't use complicated words\nReduce words and word length\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T12:21:44.082116022Z","tags":null},"/notes/Newspaper-Column":{"title":"Newspaper Column","content":"\n[[Columnist]] \nnot on a daily basis\n\n**not** inverted pyramid \nnot purely factual so [[soft news]]\n**opinion-based**\nhuman-interest stories(?)\nstyle of columnist is important; style \u003e substance\n\ntopic - no specific or set topic, can be about anything that interests people; \nstyle is dependent on columnist, more flexible\ncan be in tabloids AND broadsheets\n\n1.
