The shrine as<br>you can see is built out of wood, never a<br>material prized for millennial scale<br>structural integrity but the (???)<br>priests who run the shrine know that so<br>periodically they have a ceremony where<br>they tear the shrine to the ground and<br>then they go to the forest where the<br>wood from the original shrine built in<br>690 came from and they build another<br>shrine out of the same kind of material<br>on the same spot to the same architectural plan<br>and from their point of view,<br>since the function of the shrine<br>is to delineate sacred space from<br>ordinary space the shrine has been there<br>for 1300 years. It&rsquo;s just built out of<br>renewable materials<br>UNESCO&rsquo;s response was that&rsquo;s not what we mean when we say<br>historic. Right? what we care about is solidity of edifice<br>not solidity of process.<br>Hold that thought. In 1995 I was in<br>charge of technology for a little web<br>shop in Manhattan or a dozen of us<br>working out of Seth(???) Goldstein&rsquo;s living<br>room; it was very picturesque and like<br>the dog that caught the&mldr; proverbial dog<br>that caught the bus we landed AT&T as a<br>client.<br>We had some calendaring technology they wanted to use and<br>they hired us to build some web sites and<br>once the ink on the contract was dry the engineers came<br>around and so of course we had to have a<br>fight about programming languages. It&rsquo;s<br>like hello between techies so this was<br>big culture clash. Most of those guys had<br>been at AT&T longer than most of us had<br>been out of college. They were C++<br>engineers, C++ having been invented at<br>AT&T.<br>We were Perl hackers, so already<br>they were horrified and we fought back<br>and forth about the relative merits of<br>each language and the place they really<br>thought they had us was on support.<br>&ldquo;Where can you possibly get commercial support<br>for Perl?&rdquo; and we said &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have any&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have any support?!&rdquo;<br>we said &ldquo;We&mldr; we didn&rsquo;t say that, we said we don&rsquo;t<br>have commercial support. We get our support from the<br>Perl community&rdquo;<br>and from the looks on their faces you could tell<br>as if it was, as if we had told them &ldquo;We get our<br>Thursday&rsquo;s from a banana&rdquo;<br>like it just didn&rsquo;t make any sense<br>what we just said. They&rsquo;d never heard the words community<br>and support in the same sentence<br>So it&rsquo;s another &ldquo;look look there&rsquo;s this, there&rsquo;s<br>this news group comp Lang Perl misc&rdquo;, all<br>right and we go to that news group and<br>we post our questions and other people<br>answer them and other people post their<br>questions and we answer them. We all kind<br>of get it done together. This did not<br>make any sense. More arguing. &ldquo;Look&rdquo;<br>we said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll show you&rdquo;. So we come up<br>with a moderately complicated question<br>we post it to Usenet, we had an answer<br>before the meeting was over and who it<br>was at that moment that I understood<br>what was going on. Because they didn&rsquo;t<br>care. They didn&rsquo;t care that they&rsquo;d seen<br>it work in practice because they already<br>knew it couldn&rsquo;t work in theory. Right.<br>Support is critical. You don&rsquo;t get<br>support from something as evanescent as<br>an unspoken bargain in a community;<br>support comes from something concrete<br>like a contract with a company. right. so<br>we had that argument a dozen years ago<br>what&rsquo;s going on now well the slide I<br>just pulled up and I&rsquo;ll pull up again is<br>actually from yesterday this is from<br>comp lang perl misc from yesterday.<br>People are still asking questions people<br>are still answering questions with the<br>explosion of social media that we&rsquo;ve<br>seen there&rsquo;s obviously lots and lots of<br>places to talk about perl now but the<br>original site of the conversation and<br>the the source of the argument comp Lang<br>perl misc is doing fine. And AT&T. How&rsquo;s AT&T<br>doing? Not as fine, right, so in fact<br>right, th-the solidity was on the side<br>of the thing that looked evanescent.<br>Perl is a Shinto shrine. Perl exists not as<br>an edifice but as an act of love.<br>Perl is a viable programming option again<br>today because millions of people woke up<br>this morning loving perl, and more<br>importantly, they love one another in the<br>context of perl. They love one another<br>enough to stop what they&rsquo;re doing and<br>listen to each other to have a<br>conversation (???? to Denise&rsquo;s point) and to<br>answer questions for one another, to<br>diagnose things for one another,<br>sometimes to write codes for one another.<br>Oh I think I see what&rsquo;s going on here<br>Try this - no contracts are written, no<br>money changes hands, the work goes on.<br>We don&rsquo;t often talk about love at<br>gatherings like this it seems too<br>squishy and certainly seem too squishy<br>to the AT&T guys but what has<br>happened, what is happening in our<br>generation right now is that we have a set<br>of tools for aggregating things that<br>people care about in ways that increase<br>both the scope and the longevity in ways<br>that were unpredictable even a decade<br>ago. right. The coordinating tools we now<br>have, and I&rsquo;m not talking about anything<br>fancy, I&rsquo;m talking about mailing lists<br>and Usenet and web blogs and wikis;<br>those tools turn love into a renewable<br>building material.<br>In the middle of the 90s most software was commercially<br>manufactured, but there were a handful of<br>things whose only visible means of<br>support was love plus mailing lists.<br>Which doesn&rsquo;t seem like a very<br>auspicious place to start. Perl. Apache.<br>Linux. But standing there and looking<br>today, and more importantly standing from<br>today looking towards the future you<br>will make more accurate predictions<br>about about software, and in this web<br>driven world about services, if you ask<br>yourself not what&rsquo;s the business model<br>but rather &ldquo;do the people who like it<br>take care of each other?&rdquo;<br>That turns out to be the better predictor of longevity<br>The (???) priests would totally get Linux<br>Linux gets rebuilt every night by people whose principle<br>goal is that it continues to exist the following morning.<br>Now this doesn&rsquo;t mean that the market is going to wither<br>away and we&rsquo;re all going to live in some<br>sort of lovely post-capitalist commune.<br>There&rsquo;s lots of commercial opportunity.<br>There has always been lots of commercial<br>opportunity; there will always be lots of<br>commercial opportunity.<br>It does mean that the ability to aggregate<br>non-financial motivations, to get people together<br>outside of managerial culture and for<br>reasons other than the profit motive has<br>received a huge comparative advantage.<br>And it also means that many of the<br>future commercial opportunities are<br>going to be inextricably intertwined<br>with that kind of work and those kind of<br>groups. Right. When Linus Torvalds posted<br>his first message in 1991 hinting at<br>what Linux was to become - it&rsquo;s a very<br>modest message &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this little<br>hobby project project in mind&rdquo;<br>within 24 hours he had responses from Stuttgart,<br>from Vienna, from San Jose, from Sydney,<br>he had a global network of collaborators<br>not asking for anything other than the<br>chance to come together and do something<br>interesting that was new. And that<br>pattern that pattern of aggregating<br>caring into something stable and<br>long-lasting is going everywhere<br>Wikipedia. The anti anti-immigration<br>protests in the California schools that<br>were coordinated through myspace. right.<br>The monitoring of the Nigerian elections<br>by a loose collection of people using<br>SMS and camera phones to watch their own<br>elected officials.<br>The use of Flickr to coordinate information and disaster<br>relief after the Indian Ocean tsunami after the London transit bombings after the Madrid bombing.<br>And the number of places that pattern will go in the future is much greater than the number of places that pattern has already gone<br>We have always loved one another we&rsquo;re<br>human it&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re good at but<br>up until recently the radius and<br>half-life of that affection has been<br>quite limited. With love alone you can<br>get a birthday party together. Add<br>coordinating tools and you can write an.<br>operating system.<br>In the past, we would do little things<br>for love. But big things, big things<br>required money. Now we can do big things<br>for love.
