But every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will return to you, all in the same sequence and succession. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again and you with it, speck of dust!<br>Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a terrific moment when you would have answered him: you are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.&rdquo; - <strong>Nietzsche</strong><br>Concept - Eternal Recurrence</p><hr><p>&ldquo;Religion is the masterpiece of the art of animal training, for it trains people as to how they shall think.&rdquo;<br>-Arthur Schopenhauer. Religion</p><p>&ldquo;A man cannot serve two masters: so it is either reason or the scriptures.&rdquo;<br>Arthur Schopenhauer. Religion</p><p>&ldquo;One should use common words to say uncommon things.&rdquo;<br>-Arthur Schopenhauer. Brevity, accessible language.</p><p>⭐ <em>“A man is never happy, but spends his whole life in striving after something that he thinks will make him so; he seldom attains his goal, and when he does, it is only to be disappointed; he is mostly shipwrecked in the end, and comes into harbour with mast and rigging gone. And then, it is all one whether he is happy or miserable; for his life was never anything more than a present moment always vanishing; and now it is over.”</em><br>― Arthur Schopenhauer, Studies in Pessimism: The Essays</p><hr><h2 id=queer-nation-manifestohttpswwwhistoryisaweaponcomdefcon1queernationhtml><a href=https://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/queernation.html rel=noopener>Queer Nation Manifesto</a></h2><ol><li><p><em>⭐"Being queer means leading a different sort of life. It&rsquo;s not about the mainstream, profit-margins, patriotism, patriarchy or being assimilated. It&rsquo;s not about executive directors, privilege and elitism. <strong>It&rsquo;s about being on the margins, defining ourselves; it&rsquo;s about gender-f&mdash; and secrets, what&rsquo;s beneath the belt and deep inside the heart; it&rsquo;s about the night.</strong> Being queer is &ldquo;grass roots&rdquo; because we know that everyone of us, every body, every c&mdash;, every heart and a&ndash; and d&mdash; is a world of pleasure waiting to be explored. Everyone of us is a world of infinite possibility."</em></p></li><li><p>How can I tell you. How can I convince you, brother; sister that your life is in danger. That everyday you wake up alive, relatively happy, and a functioning human being, you are committing a rebellious act. You as an alive and functioning queer are a revolutionary. There is nothing on this planet that validates, protects or encourages your existence. It is a miracle you are standing here reading these words. You should by all rights be dead.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled, straight people own the world and the only reason you have been spared is you&rsquo;re smart, lucky, or a fighter. Straight people have a privilege that allows them to do whatever they please and f&mdash; without fear. But not only do they live a life free of fear; they flaunt their freedom in my face. Their images are on my TV, in the magazine I bought, in the restaurant I want to eat in, and on the street where I live. I want there to be a moratorium on straight marriage, on babies, on public displays of affection among the opposite sex and media images that promote heterosexuality. Until I can enjoy the same freedom of movement and sexuality, as straights, their privilege must stop and it must be given over to me and my queer sisters and brothers.</p><p>Straight people will not do this voluntarily and so they must be forced into it. Straights must be frightened into it. Terrorized into it. Fear is the most powerful motivator. No one will give us what we deserve. Rights are not given they are taken, by force if necessary.</p><p>It is easier to fight when you know who your enemy is. Straight people are you enemy. They are your enemy when they don&rsquo;t acknowledge your invisibility and continue to live in and contribute to a culture that kills you.</p><p>Every day one of us is taken by the enemy. Whether it is an AIDS death due to homophobic government inaction or a lesbian bashing in an all-night diner (in a supposedly lesbian neighborhood), we are being systematically picked off and we will continue to be wiped out unless we realize that if they take one of us they must take all of us.</p></li><li><p><strong>The strong sisters told the brothers that there were two important things to remember about the coming revolutions. The first is that we will get our a&ndash;es kicked. The second is that we will win.</strong></p></li><li><p>I hate straight people who think they have anything intelligent to say about &ldquo;outing.&rdquo; I hate straight people who think stories about themselves are &ldquo;universal&rdquo; but stories about us are only about homosexuality. I hate straight recording artists who make their careers off of queer people, then attack us, then act hurt when we get angry and then deny having wronged us rather than apologize for it. I hate straight people who say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you feel the need to wear those buttons and t-shirts. I don&rsquo;t go around tell the whole world I&rsquo;m straight.&rdquo;</p><p>I hate that in twelve years of public education I was never taught about queer people. I hate that I grew up thinking I was the only queer in the world, and I hate even more that most queer kids still grow up the same way. I hate that I was tormented by other kids for being a faggot, but more that I was taught to feel ashamed for being the object of their cruelty, taught to feel it was my fault. I hate that the Supreme Court of this country says it&rsquo;s okay to criminalize me because of how I make love. I hate that so many straight people are so concerned about my goddamned sex life. I hate that so many twisted straight people become parents, while I have to fight like hell to be <em>allowed</em> to be a father. I hate straights.</p></li></ol><hr><p>&ldquo;Let go or be dragged&rdquo;</p><hr><p><em>When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, “Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.”</em> - <a class="internal-link broken">Fred Rogers</a> <a href=/cuddly-train/meta/blog/McFeely rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/cuddly-train/meta/blog/McFeely>McFeely</a></p><hr><p>&ldquo;The past haunts the present.<br>Your bedroom floor doesn&rsquo;t stop being dirty just coz you stopped dropping food all over the carpet.
