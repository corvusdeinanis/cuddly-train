[[Normal Distribution]]
The normal curve, also known as the bell curve or the Gaussian curve, is a symmetrical and continuous probability distribution that describes the variation of many natural phenomena.</description></item><item><title>Normal Distribution</title><link>https://corvusdeinanis.github.io/cuddly-train/Normal-Distribution/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://corvusdeinanis.github.io/cuddly-train/Normal-Distribution/</guid><description>~68% fall under the normal
[[Normal Curve]]
describes how data is spread out around a central value. For example, if you measure the heights of many people, you will find that most of them are close to the average height, and only a few are much taller or shorter.</description></item><item><title>Ethical Considerations in Research</title><link>https://corvusdeinanis.github.io/cuddly-train/Ethical-Considerations-in-Research/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://corvusdeinanis.github.io/cuddly-train/Ethical-Considerations-in-Research/</guid><description>Ethical considerations are principles that guide research
