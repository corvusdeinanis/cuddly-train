Researchers have demonstrated repeatedly in human surveys the stylized fact that, far from being an oracule or gold standard, a certain small percentage of human responses will reliably be bullshit: “jokester” or “mischievous responders”, or more memorably, “lizardman constant” responders—respondents who give the wrong answer to simple questions.</description></item><item><title>Empirical Rule Three Sigma</title><link>https://corvusdeinanis.github.io/cuddly-train/Empirical-Rule-Three-Sigma/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://corvusdeinanis.github.io/cuddly-train/Empirical-Rule-Three-Sigma/</guid><description>68–95–99.7 rule is a shorthand used to remember the percentage of values that lie within an interval estimate in a [[Normal Distribution]]: 68%, 95%, and 99.</description></item><item><title>Pareto principle</title><link>https://corvusdeinanis.github.io/cuddly-train/Pareto-principle/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://corvusdeinanis.github.io/cuddly-train/Pareto-principle/</guid><description>80/20 rule or rule of vital few

It shows how the prior probability of a hypothesis (what we already know or assume) and the likelihood of the evidence (how well the evidence supports the hypothesis) affect the posterior probability of the hypothesis (what we learn after seeing the evidence).</description></item><item><title>Normal Curve</title><link>https://corvusdeinanis.github.io/cuddly-train/Normal-Curve/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://corvusdeinanis.github.io/cuddly-train/Normal-Curve/</guid><description>(red curve is the normal curve)

[[Normal Distribution]]
The normal curve, also known as the bell curve or the Gaussian curve, is a symmetrical and continuous probability distribution that describes the variation of many natural phenomena.</description></item><item><title>t test</title><link>https://corvusdeinanis.github.io/cuddly-train/t-test/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://corvusdeinanis.github.io/cuddly-train/t-test/</guid><description>A t-test is a simple way of comparing two groups of data to see if they are different from each other.</description></item><item><title>Measurement and Types of Measurement and Important Questions</title><link>https://corvusdeinanis.github.io/cuddly-train/Measurement-and-Types-of-Measurement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://corvusdeinanis.github.io/cuddly-train/Measurement-and-Types-of-Measurement/</guid><description>Define measurement and types of measurement
